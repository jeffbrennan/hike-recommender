This popular loop offers incredible views, with some challenging rung and ladder sections. This loop starts at the Sand Beach Parking Lot, traverses over the Beehive, reaches the Bowl Pond, and then loops back on the Bowl Trail.\n\nAlthough the loop could technically be done in either direction, the counterclockwise way is highly recommended. Going counterclockwise, you go up the rungs and ladders, which is much easier than going down them. Also, this way you get the climb out of the way early, and the rest is smooth sailing.\n\nStarting out from Sand Beach, the trailhead is across Park Loop Road. You\u2019ll be on the Bowl Trail briefly, before turning right onto the Beehive Trail. This part of the trail requires scrambling, climbing ladders, steading yourself with rungs, and ascending steep granite staircases. This section can be very challenging, and is not recommended for people with a fear of heights. There are steep cliff drop offs next to the trail.\n\nAfter taking in the views from The Beehive, continue along the trail to the Bowl Pond. Along the way, you\u2019ll see the Bowl Connector Trail on the left. This trail shortens the loop, if you\u2019re starting to get tired or running out of time. If you take this connector, you will not be able to view the Bowl Pond.\n\nAfter checking out the pond, return to the parking area along the Bowl Trail.

Starting from the trailhead at the parking lot, climb near and cross over a stream bed through the forest and sometimes slippery rocks to a junction with a boulder marking the trail.  From the boulder the trail can be an out and back (left fork) or a loop (left or right fork).  For the loop, take the right fork going up - \"Scenic/Ridge Trail\" and at the top of the ridge take a left along the Scenic Trail to the Maiden Cliff and the Elenora French cross.  Or take the left fork to go straight up (either way is about the same distance).  Recommend the loop.  The hike to the cliff will normally take around forty-five minutes to an hour to complete.  Hiking poles may help navigate the several steep areas that don't have adequate handholds (other than trees and roots and rocks).  Also be careful in wet conditions as the rocks can be very slippery.  The views at the top are worth the effort.\n\nHistory of the cross:\nThe white cross on top of Maiden's Cliff is a memorial to Elenora French, an 11-year old girl who fell from the cliff on May 7, 1864. She climbed the cliff along with her older sister, friends, and teacher when a sudden gust of wind blew her hat off. According to her older sisters account, Elenora successfully caught her hat and sat on a rock near the edge of the cliff but while she was putting it back on, another gust of wind pushed her off the edge, falling 300 feet. Elenora was still alive when they climbed down to her and she did not even sustain any broken bones. Unfortunately, she suffered internal injuries and died the next day.  To remember Elenora French and her tragic end on this beautiful but dangerous cliff, Joseph B. Steams had a cross erected on the site at the top of the cliff.  The simple white cross after years of exposure to weather and elements gave way and had to be replaced more than once. The cross put up in 1947 was blown down on January 17, 1980 and replaced with a new cross that weighed 600 pounds and measured 12 feet by 24 feet. Helicopters of the Air National Guard installed this fourth replacement of Elenoras Memorial Cross.\n\nOn September 15, 1986, Roy Brown and Sam Dyer, together with their tools and supplies, climbed the trail to install a monument donated by Coastal Monuments and Laite Funeral Home. It was inscribed with the words, In memory of Elenora French Brown and Dyer installed the memorial at the base of the cross, drilling into the rock.\n\nIn May of 1988, vandals toppled the cross and destroyed the hard work the two men had given to the memorial two years earlier. The Camden Fire Department Rescue team and Camden Parks and Recreation Department volunteers and members labored for long hours to put the cross right again. Two helicopters from the 240th Engineer Group of the Maine National Guard also helped in putting the cross upright once again, secured with cables from a donation from the Wayfarer Marine Corporation.\n\nWhen the cross south arm broke off, it was replaced with a steel cross donated by Frank OHara Jr.   On Memorial Day 1992, the steel cross was installed, reinforced with epoxy paint to withstand natures elements and secured with cables donated by the Wayfarer Marine Corporation once again. This cross still stands today.

Designed for recreation and nature appreciation by the Vaughans in the early 1900s, classic stone bridges, picturesque waterfalls, and other windows into the past make these some of the most unique walking trails in Maine. In 1991, prior to the Homesteads incorporation as a nonprofit, then owners Diana Vaughan Gibson and her husband George, donated a conservation easement on the Woods to The Kennebec Land Trust, ensuring its protection for future generations. Today, the Homestead manages the Woods for public use and allows access from dawn to dusk for recreational activities such as trail walking, nature study, picnicking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. The Woods contains approximately 3 miles of trails that vary in width and degree of difficulty for walking.\n\nThe easement on Vaughan Woods covers all of its lands. The Kennebec Land Trust, which holds the easement, is a private nonprofit membership organization formed in 1988 by local citizens to work cooperatively with landowners and communities to protect natural features, working landscapes, and fragile ecosystems. The KLT owns or protects over 4,000 acres of land in the Kennebec Valley, and works with the Vaughan Homestead Foundation, the Hallowell Conservation Commission, and the Maine Conservation Corps, to protect and maintain the Vaughan Woods.

The trail then connects with a discontinued portion of Gambo Road, now closed to automobile traffic, whose paved surface is still adequate for biking.\n\nThe trail continues to follow Gambo Road east to a pedestrian bridge above the Gambo Dam. Along the way, there are visible remnants of the Cumberland and Oxford Canal and a submerged ruin of the Oriental Powder Mill. Those wishing to complete the Curtis Loop will need to travel uphill slightly, turn left onto the gravel road and reenter the Mountain Division Rail Trail at the end of this road.\n\nThe second half of the Presumpscot River Trail also provides access to the Presumpscot Regional Land Trust's Gambo Property and the Gunpower Mill Trail and Canal Towpath Trail trailheads. The property was once the Oriental Powder Mill, the first (1824) and largest gunpowder mill in Maine. During the Civil War, the Oriental Powder Mill supplied the Union Army with a quarter of its gunpowder! The mill closed in 1905, just prior to the construction of the adjacent Gambo Dam.\n\nStarting near the dam on old Gambo Road, the Gunpowder Mill Trail tours the entire grounds of the former mill. Numerous ruins dot the trail, and wayside markers describe the significance of each ruin. The quarter-mile-long Gunpowder Mill Trail ends at the Canal Towpath Trail.\n\nThe Canal Towpath Trail follows the old route of the Cumberland and Oxford Canal. In addition to the still visible canal prism, the trail also crosses an old weir (a water overflow structure) and passes along one of the now ruined canal locks.\n\nAccessibility: There do not appear to be any designated accessible spaces in the gravel parking lot off of Partridge Lane at the west end of the trail. There do not appear to be any designated accessible parking spaces within 1.0 miles of the trailhead. The trail surface is paved asphalt or gravel. It is typically at least 8 feet wide. There is a gate across the trail at the start and the estimated width to go around it is 3 feet. There are 2 railroad crossings at about 0.9 and 1.3 miles when going counterclockwise. The railroad crossings have been marked with waypoints.\n\nThe most accessible portion of the trail is the paved portion in the first about 0.6 miles when going counterclockwise.

Sebago Lake provides drinking water to 200,000 people in the greater Portland region.\n\nMany features of the Land Reserve, sharp elevation changes in particular, were shaped by glacial movement 13,000 years ago. The steep slope that runs between Bobcat Trail and Horsetail Trail is called a kame slope and was formed by glacial deposits. This stark contrast in elevation results in markedly different plant communities. A maze of springs, streams, and wetlands borders the Horsetail Trail, which can be found at the bottom of the kame slope. A comparison of plant communities between the bottom and the top of the kame slope may reveal the hidden story of soil and hydrology underfoot. \n\nThe Otter Ponds are a testament to previous glacial activity and are a type of kettlehole depression. Kettlehole depressions were formed from glacial ice that became trapped in layers of sand and gravel that, once melted, left rounded, steep-sided depressions. The Otter Ponds (the collection of Half Moon Pond, Otter Ponds, and Snake Pond) are spring-fed ponds known as kettlehole lakes. These ponds are a popular destination for brook trout, largemouth bass, pickerel, and hornpout anglers and are accessible along Mallard Trail. The Otter Ponds are bordered by a set of trails that provide contrasting settings of a predominantly dense White Pine tree community along the Acadia Loop and the sun flecked Oak-dominated tree community along the Snake View and Pond View Trails. Sightings of cicadas, Great Blue Herons, Belted Kingfishers, Cedar Waxwings, snakes, several butterfly and moth species, and frogs near the Otter Ponds add to the appeal of these trails. \n\nThe Otter Ponds are not the only place to spot wildlife. Vernal pools and their amphibian inhabitants are scattered throughout the land reserve. These seasonally filled pools assist in reducing erosion and polluted runoff by holding water from spring rains and slowly releasing it back into the ground. Additionally, vernal pools provide a safe habitat for breeding amphibians that rely on fishless waterbodies to lay their eggs. Several species, including the spotted salamander, blue spotted salamander, wood frog, and fairy shrimp, all rely on vernal pools exclusively to raise their broods. The animals that call these unique habitats home are food for many other animals like the Barred Owl, raccoons, foxes, and hawks. The Wetland Loop offers excellent views of such a habitat and is the perfect length for children.", "duration_minutes": 37, "duration_minutes_hiking": 37, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 19, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 14, "duration_minutes_cycling": 11, "objectID": "trail-10256919"}, {"ID": 10357457, "slug": "trail/us/maine/tunk-mountain-ridge-trail", "popularity": 9.3975, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 44.62518, "lng": -68.08894}, "length": 5793.624, "elevation_gain": 270.9672, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "1", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10110235, "area_slug": "parks/us/maine/donnell-pond-public-reserved-land", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 2855, "state_id": 20, "verified_map_id": 21591836, "activities": ["hiking", "snowshoeing"], "profile_photo_data": "21310935-db8f25cd3834342bf8b20d0eaa4a9495", "num_reviews": 197, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 387, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1545342607, "name": "Tunk Mountain Ridge Trail", "city_name": "Franklin", "state_name": "Maine", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Donnell Pond Public Reserved Land", "description": "Begin at the trailhead off Blackswoods Road, there is an informational board at the trailhead with a map and info on the area.\n\nThe trail will lead past Salmon and Mud Pond before gaining the ridge line leading to the summit of Tunk Mountain.

It has become an increasingly popular destination for hikers and backpackers wishing to hike a loop. It is often used by camp and school groups.\n\nThe trail is a rugged, remote backcountry trail, much of it on private land. The only camping is at four designated campsites on the eastern section and four on the western section. Water is available at each campsite. From the Grafton Loop Trailhead, the closest campsite on the eastern section is 5 miles from the road, on the other side of 3,000-foot Puzzle Mountain. Please prepare accordingly.\n\nDirections to Grafton Loop Trail trailhead: \nThe southern trailhead is located just north of where Eddy Road meets Route 26 in Newry, Maine. From the junction of Route 2 and Route 26, travel North on Route 26 (towards Grafton Notch State Park) 4.7 miles and turn right into a gravel parking area. The trail leaves from the end of this parking area at the sign.\n\nTrail directions from the GLT trailhead:\n\nEastern Section to AT parking lot in Grafton Notch:\nThe trail leaves Route 26 and continues 17.1 miles to the summit of East Baldpate where it intersects with the Appalachian Trail. It is 4 miles from there, south on the AT back to Route 26 and the large trailhead parking lot in Grafton Notch State Park.\nWestern Section, to AT parking lot in Grafton Notch\nThe western section of the Trail has been open for use since 2003. It may be accessed from the Grafton Loop trailhead on Rt. 26 by walking south on Route 26 for .5 miles to the trail sign on the road. From here, it heads across a field to a snowmobile bridge across the Bear River. The trail then follows a series of minor peaks before traversing Sunday River Whitecap. Unique trail structures were designed and built on Sunday River Whitecap to protect fragile plants unique to the area.\nAfter Sunday River Whitecap, the trail skirts the slide on Slide Mountain, descends slightly into the upper Bull Branch (of the Sunday River) valley, and finally climbs the southern flank of Old Speck to reconnect with the AT.\n\nIn 2011, a new 1.8-mile side trail off the GLT was opened. The Woodsum Spur traverses the open ledges around the summit of Puzzle before returning to the GLT.\n\n\nIf you are interested in helping to maintain the GLT, please contact MATC Baldpate District Overseer Tom Gorrill at woodencanoeboy@gmail.com or (207) 657-4249; or Kim Marion, AMC North Country Volunteer Coordinator at 603-466-2721 X192.\n\nThis significant trail-building effort was done over a six-year period by members of the Grafton Loop Trail Coalition, which includes the Appalachian Mountain Club, Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands, the Maine Appalachian Trail Club, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the Maine Conservation Corps, Hurricane Island Outward Bound School, several timber management companies, Sunday River Ski Resort, and other private landowners. Funding was provided by several private donors and foundations, as well as by the Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund and federal Recreational Trails Program funding.\n\nThis trail is partially within the 9,993-acre Mahoosuc Ecological Reserve, which, like all Maine State Ecological Reserves, is specifically set aside to protect and monitor natural ecosystems. More information about the reserve can be found at Maine Natural Areas Program\u2019s Ecoreserve Fact Sheet for Mahoosuc Unit.

You cross over a stone wall into a red maple swamp. In the spring, listen for the sounds of returning neo-tropical migrant birds and in the winter, look for the flitting silhouettes of chickadees shivering for warmth. Leaving the red maple swamp you find yourself on one of the several hummocks in the preserve, a nutrient rich glacial deposit where hemlocks have taken root. Venturing out to the Muddy River, a ripple in the water and a loud splash indicates the presence of a territorial beaver.\n\nReturning to the trail, you eventually make your way to the place where plants eat insects, moose wallow in the muddy waters, and minks scurry about looking for fish: the Holt Pond Overlook. The Holt Pond Overlook boardwalk crosses over a quaking mat of sphagnum moss. If you bend your knees twice, you will see a slight quaking motion at the end of the boardwalk. This is because the sphagnum moss is floating, colonizing the open water in front of you. The quaking bog is home to pitcher plants, orchids, leatherleaf, swamp rose, and many other unique plants, as it is one of the most diverse natural communities at Holt Pond. Pause at the end of the boardwalk and appreciate the beauty of this spot in every season, when migrant ducks swim about, water lilies dot the surface, reflected red, yellow, orange, and brown leaves shine in the depths, or snow and ice insulate the vibrant life underneath.\n\nAfter the Holt Pond outlook, the trails heads back into a hemlock grove, through red maple low lands and then up to within sight of Grist Mill Road. The trails continues over more dry woodland before returning to a boardwalk through red maple swamp and eventually to another trail head on the Knapp Road off of Fosterville Road.\n\nThe trail then continues along the south shore of Holt Pond which is dryer but less used then other trail sections.

The system includes a 0.7 universally accessible trail to a scenic outlook and a 2.2 miles hiking/dog walking snowshoe trail.\n\nThe Roberts Farm Preserve offers an intricate trail system designed to support many outdoor activities year round. Much of the 165-acre piece of land is covered with both hard and soft woods and is situated above Lake Pennesseewassee, allowing expansive views of the lake and mountains beyond. The property and the parking area are conveniently located off of ME Routes 118 and 117 offering easy access for residents and visitors of the Oxford Hills Region. The trail system includes three types of trails: an ADA compliant loop, two cross-country ski trails of differing widths, and a hiking trail. With the exception of the hiking trail, all trails are open to multiple non-motorized uses.\n\nThe ADA compliant trail offers a loop with a hike to a scenic view point. The loop, called a bird-feeder trail, is suitable for young children on skis or foot and is user-friendly for the elderly and handicapped. The scenic view trail, also wheelchair accessible, takes visitors to a scenic overlook of Lake Pennesseewassee. The trail has a width of 8 feet and has a smooth and stable surface of 1.5 inch screened gravel. In the spring, summer, and fall, this trail supports stroller and wheelchair users along with runners, and walkers. In the winter, one set of classic ski tracks is set. In short, this trail offers people of all ages and abilities access to the outdoors.\n\nRoberts Farm Preserve currently provides skiers and runners with 6.5 km of intermediate trails with a width of 12 feet that will be groomed for an 8-foot wide skate lane and a 4-foot wide classic set of tracks for skiing. The trail offers numerous loops of moderate difficulty and options for skiing on sections of trail with the most difficult ratings. All trails take advantage of the wooded forest, which allows for shade in the summer and wind protection in the winter. The trails also follow streams, old road beds, and stonewalls with three significant stream crossings over a 14-foot wide bridges.\n\nThe hiking trail has two access points: at the Roberts Farm parking lot and at the rest area across from Lake Pennesseewassee on ME Routes 118 and 117. The 2km trail from the rest area climbs to the wider trail and follows it to the scenic point where it continues to weave around and through the trail system to the parking lot at Roberts Farm.
