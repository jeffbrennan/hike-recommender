There are no motorboats or fishing allowed on the lake, making it an ideal destination for kayakers and swimmers.\n\nThe Rattlesnake Ledge Trail leaves from the parking lot on the north side of the lake. You\u2019ll wind your way up the mountain and eventually meet up with the Rattlesnake Mountain Trail. First, you\u2019ll come to the lower ledge. Here, you\u2019ll have fantastic views of Mount Si and Mount Washington. Shortly after, you\u2019ll come to the Middle Ledge and then the Upper Ledge. Although this hike features relatively less elevation gain than some of Washington\u2019s other iconic climbs, the journey to the top of the Rattlesnake Ledges has all the great views you could hope for. \n\nAt the end of this route, you can choose to continue along the ridge of Rattlesnake Mountain for a full-day hike. Visitors looking to explore the park\u2019s larger trail network can also find several connecting trails within the Rattlesnake Ridge parking area. You can find the Snoqualmie Valley Trail when leaving the parking area. This is a great trail if you\u2019re looking for an easy hike or bike ride.

After roughly two miles from the start you\u2019ll reach Panorama Point. The views here are incredible. After resting a bit, continue eastward on the Skyline Trail.\n\nIf you\u2019re tired or crunched for time, you can take a shortcut back via the Golden Gate Trail. If you\u2019d like to complete the full Skyline Trail, continue eastward, and you\u2019ll eventually reach Sluiskin Falls.

This permit needs to be obtained many months in advance. In addition, There is a $5 fee to park at the trailhead or you can use America the Beautiful ($80/year), Northwest Forest Pass ($30/year).\n\nIn the summer, Mount St. Helens Summit via Ptarmigan Trail is a nice and tough hike for users excited about elevation gain. In the winter, it can be turned into a snowshoe/climbing route.There are 2 primary routes: the \"summer\" (Monitor Ridge) route starts at the Climber's Bivouac trailhead. The \"winter\" (Worm Flows) route trailhead is at Marble Mountain Sno-Park.\n\nMount St. Helens is an active volcano in southwest Washington State and the central feature of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. This is a popular climb for both beginning and experienced mountaineers. Although people are able to climb Mount St. Helens year-round, late spring through early fall is the most popular season since most of this trail is without snow, and the route takes users to popular areas such as Spirit Lake, Coldwater Lake, the Boulder Fields, and Windy Ridge.\n\nIt is very important to review the weather forecast prior to climbing, since the experience and safety of this trail can vary drastically if attempting in poor conditions. It is best to start very early in the morning, since both climbs rise steadily as you go up in altitude. The wind and the altitude can affect many climbers but as with all physical activity being in shape to attempt these climbs is a must. At the summit, users have amazing views atop the clouds. Glissading makes the trip much faster coming down when there is enough snow. Users can review the weather using this website: http://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Mount-Saint-Helens/forecasts/2549\n\nIt's highly recommended to climb in spring or early summer when the Climber's Bivouac opens. The Worms Flows (Marble Mountain Sno-Park) is an option if winter snows have made Climber's Bivouac inaccessible. Although strenuous, both of these non-technical climbing routes are suitable for people in good physical condition who are comfortable scrambling on steep, rugged terrain. Most climbers complete the round trip in seven to twelve hours. While climbing to the crater rim is permitted, entry into the crater is strictly prohibited.

The wildlife is beautiful and users may see marmots, mountain goats, a black bear, pica, mule deer, and grouse. During October, the meadows will all turn red and yellow and are a sight to see for the North Cascades National Park. The lake along the way was gorgeous and will reflect the mountains if not snow or ice-covered.\n\nIf hoping to spend the night at Sahale Glacier Camp, users recommend obtaining a permit for camping up there, since it is beautiful. Users can grab a permit from North Cascades Ranger Station in Marblemount a day prior to the trek, and they should go early since it will still be difficult to get a permit for weekends, but the wait is worth it! The camping at the summit includes fresh glacier water with beautiful 360-degree views.\n\nWhen heading to the trailhead on the road, users should have a good vehicle, since the road leading to the trailhead is bumpy gravel.

Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and traverses into Morningstar National Resources Conservation Area managed by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. The trail ends at Foggy Lake where experienced mountaineers gain access to climb Del Campo and Gothic Peaks. Camping is allowed in the basin and surrounding area, but campfires are prohibited.\n\nStart at the Barlow Pass Trailhead and pass the metal gate just south of the parking. Proceed for 1-1.5 miles along an old gravel road that parallels the Sauk River. After you pass the Monte Cristo trailhead, keep walking until the trail comes to a fork. Proceed to the right going into the forest until you see the trailhead for Weden Creek/Gothin Basin #724. There is also an old outhouse. Proceed past the sign until you see the large sign for the Weden Creek Trail. The trail starts off with a gentle grade incline through the sheltering forest for about a mile. A couple of small stream crossings will be passed. About 1.5 miles into the trail, a series of switchbacks (about 20) will begin. The switchbacks are moderate at first then the incline starts to ascend pretty dramatically.\n\nLeading out of the forest, you will arrive at the first major waterfall. Continue onward and upward crossing to the left of the waterfall. The trail then begins to get very rough and rocky continuing this way throughout the rest of the hike. Some of the pathway is very narrow, hugging the edge of the mountain with thick overgrowth. \n\nThe final ascent into the basin is very steep amongst rocks and flat boulders. You will then arrive at Gothic Basin when you see a small lake surrounded by numerous peaks at 4.5 miles into the hike. The hike to Foggy Lake is about 20 minutes past Gothic Basin. It is probably about half a mile away with another 500 ft of additional elevation gain. There is not a clear trail to the lake. You will not see any views at the base of Gothic Basin. The higher you go, the better the views get. After reaching the top of the first ridge the view is magnificent seeing the small lake on the bottom and the different surrounding mountains/peaks. The view is worth the difficult journey.

While the towns are gone you will still be able to view some artifacts from the past. Along the way you will see a coal mine shaft and an information kiosk where you can learn more about its history. There are also a few railroad cart turntables but they are difficult to spot as their concrete foundations are all that is left and the forest has now grown over them. During your hike you will also catch the smell of coal and burnt cinders from time to time.\n\nMost of the trail is packed dirt but there are a few hills that can be slippery especially after it rains. If you start your journey from the Red Town parking lot, you will quickly come across an old coal mine shaft. It has been sealed but when standing next to it you can still smell the coal from below. Next to the mine is an information kiosk that will provide you with a little history of the area. It is interesting to read about the towns that were here and try to imagine what life would have been like while traversing the trail of today. On the kiosk you will see a few photos of the miners and their mining village. A little further down you will come to the North Fork Falls along with a few benches to sit and enjoy the waterfall. The falls are not large and it is best to visit them after a few days of heavy rain. From here you will walk through the forest and onto a short section of the trail composed of gravel. The trail is mostly a gentle down hill hike where you will make a few stream crossings on the newly renovated bridges. Soon you will find yourself in a clearing with many black berry bushes, watch out for the thorns as the trail is overgrown at times. Once you make your way back into the shaded forest the trail begins its steep decline. At first you will be hiking down a small ridge but it will begin getting steeper and muddier from here.  For this next section you may need to take advantage of the trees and their roots to guide yourself down, especially if the trail is wet. Once at the bottom the trail will level out and you will come to the last two bridges. Once you cross the first bridge you will come to the Forest Drive trailhead. Continue straight to cross another bridge and a short distance later you will see a small retention pond along with the fish ladders at the end of the trail.\n\nThis hike will provide you and your family with a great short outing along with some history. However, if you are looking for a longer hike there are 2 connecting trails, Primrose Trail (.8 miles) and the Forest Drive Trail (about 4 miles out and back depending on route), which can make this a full day hike.", "duration_minutes": 126, "duration_minutes_hiking": 126, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 63, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 46, "duration_minutes_cycling": 36, "objectID": "trail-10029568"}, {"ID": 10027071, "slug": "trail/us/washington/boulder-river-trail", "popularity": 27.2144, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 48.2509, "lng": -121.81616}, "length": 14162.192, "elevation_gain": 501.7008, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "3", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10159004, "area_slug": "parks/us/washington/boulder-river-wilderness", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 267, "state_id": 48, "verified_map_id": 18038397, "activities": ["birding", "hiking", "nature-trips", "trail-running"], "profile_photo_data": "36663294-8d6e88836e2dab21d4e5afc8f9809124", "num_reviews": 1123, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 1412, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1550687661, "name": "Boulder River Trail", "city_name": "Arlington", "state_name": "Washington", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Boulder River Wilderness", "description": "The waterfall is unnamed, which is surprising considering its height and beauty.

nature trail is located at the Sunrise Visitor Center at Mt Rainier National Park, Washington. (Please note it is in an entirely different location than Paradise.) Great views of Mt Rainier, the Northern Cascades, the Tatoosh Range, etc. Moderate trail great for families, not accessible for limited mobility. Soil & loose gravel with steep drop offs in places as well as sensitive sub-alpine wildflower habitat (spring to late summer bloom) - keep kids close.  \n\nThe Sunrise Nature Trail traverses subalpine meadows just north of the Sunrise parking area. A gentle climb to the ridge top offers awesome breathtaking views of Mount Rainier, with Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, and Mount Adams in the distance. Stay on trail to protect fragile plants. Rocky Mountain goats can sometimes be seen along the trail. \n\nAt an elevation of 6,400 feet, Sunrise is the highest point that can be reached by vehicle at Mount Rainier National Park. In summer, mountain meadows abound with wildflowers. On clear summer days, Sunrise provides breathtaking views of Mount Rainier, Emmons glacier, vibrant wildflower meadows. Sunrise Point offers nearly 360-degree views of the surrounding valleys, Mount Rainier, and other volcanoes in the Cascade Range such as Mount Adams. These views and an excellent trail system make Sunrise the second most visited location in the park.\n\nThe Sunrise Road usually opens in late June or early July and closes in late September to early October.

View seabirds, whales and sea lions too.\n\nPreserved by the Makah Indian Nation, the well-maintained trail leads through wet areas, along coastal cliffs and across boardwalks. Start through a mist-drenched forest of Sitka spruce. Utilizing boardwalks and steps, drop to a series of promontories that provide great vistas of rugged Cape Flattery. At 0.75 mile is the viewing platform where you can see the Cape Flattery lighthouse on Tatoosh Island.\n\nBirds include Puffins and guillemots. Murres nest in the fortress-like cliffs. Oyster-catchers search tidal pools. Sea otters can be seen in the protected coves. Whales can often be spotted farther out.\n\nThe area is often draped in fog and receives over 100 inches of annual rainfall. Directly offshore, Tatoosh Island was named for a Makah chief, once serving as a summer fishing camp for the Makahs. The U.S. Coast Guard first constructed a lighthouse on the island in 1857, and the current structure is automated. Now only sea lions, seals, and seabirds live on Tatoosh.", "duration_minutes": 36, "duration_minutes_hiking": 36, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 18, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 13,

Mt. Adams is one of the favorite volcanoes in the Cascade Range for those want to summit one of the bigger mountains of in Washington and ski down from the top.  Due to its moderately sloped south face, it offers an outstanding ski run from the summit at 12,276 ft to the snow's end at 6-7,000 ft depending on the timing of the tour. \n\nOne caution: this is a real mountain. Despite its low terrain hazard risks of the south approach, there have been a number of injured and lost climbers on this route. The weather can turn quickly as on any major peak and climbers must be prepared to stay out overnight in some form of protection.  Many skiers with a good deal of endurance will do this climb in a single long day, but often travel very light and consequently are gambling on good weather.  This hike is suggested as a two day climb - to allow for more skiing and also to provide a cushion should the weather or snow conditions turn sour.   The snow varies from frozen crust to perfect summer corn depending on your timing and fortune.\n\nThis is a challenging climb via Cold Springs and South Spur up a 12,000 foot volcano in southern Washington. You'll climb close to 7,000 feet for this ski descent.  When you get up to the base of the glacier it will look like a highway of climbers in spring and summer months.  Hope for good snow as the descent is fantastic.  Beware - there is a false summit so be prepared to be disappointed as you crest what you think is the top, only to have to hike another half mile or so.  When you ski down get some speed from the true top and you might be able to make it partly up the false summit. \n\nDogs are allowed on this trail but probably wont be able to summit, so keep in mind your dogs hiking ability before choosing to being them.", "duration_minutes": 655, "duration_minutes_hiking": 655, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 328, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 239, "duration_minutes_cycling": 186, "objectID": "trail-10000895"}, {"ID": 10004582, "slug": "trail/us/washington/coldwater-lake-trail", "popularity": 22.9274, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 46.29218, "lng": -122.26627}, "length": 14162.192, "elevation_gain": 236.8296, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "3", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10168870, "area_slug": "parks/us/washington/mount-saint-helens-national-volcanic-monument", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 163494, "state_id": 48, "verified_map_id": 20092423, "activities": ["hiking", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "27631027-e0a1bf09c15838268e1c407b6edfe041", "num_reviews": 535, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 983, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1530209421, "name": "Coldwater Lake via Lakes Trail", "city_name": "Toutle Lake", "state_name": "Washington", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Mount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument", "description": "Gorgeous trail following along the northern side of Coldwater Lake.

Be sure to stay on the route in the map or have a map handy along the way.\n\nMima Falls is one of the highlights of the many trails that make up the expansive Capitol State Forest.  The hike is mostly easy, though you will pass through many muddy sections. It takes you through both old and new as well as cleared forests.  Mima Falls is a nice little 25 foot falls worth checking out.\n\nMima Falls takes its name from the nearby Mima Mounds. Mima is a Native term meaning a little further along. Over the years, the Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has worked with volunteers to build up the trail system in Capitol State Forest, expanding on the network of logging roads. It is likely that at least some portions of this trail are built on sections of former logging roads that once led to logging camps that supplied the sawmills in the lumber boom town of nearby Bordeaux. Established by the Bordeaux Brothers back in 1896, this area of the Black Hills were logged for over 40 years until the old growth timber ran out and Bordeaux became a ghost town in 1941.

You get excellent views of the top of the glacier (it looks like a rock wall due to a debris fall covering it in rocks) and the beautiful, turquoise runoff lake.

Continuing past this, the trail is quite nice for a short while, with a few views of what you have already seen. There are a few sections covered in ancient volcanic ash/sand, which feels really nice on bare feet. After this, the trail turns away from the ridge and continues through the forest. The trail is easy to lose at several places along the way. You will come around a bend and reach a spot with a really nice view of the mountain. This is the second spot where you may want to turn around.\n\nContinuing past this, the trail becomes increasingly difficult to follow. Coming to the end of the trail you get a fantastic view of... well- nothing at all. From there, you can scramble up to the ridge, and get a spectacular view of the same valley you have been looking at for a while.

It is worth taking a stop at the recording station just a little way in to read the plaque and appreciate the view.\n\nUpon reaching the trail, you cross what looks like a dry riverbed, and round a shady bend with a lovely small patch of forest. From there you start up the actual debris flow, and the view just never stops being breathtaking. It looks deceptively easy from here, but make no mistake, you are constantly dipping in and out of runoff channels, and many of these dip are more of a scramble than a hike.\n\nAbout 3/4 of the way in, you'll come to a small creek surrounded by trees, but do not stop just yet. You can hear the much larger creek coming from the spring just a few feet down the trail, and this is where you want to stop and rest. This is truly a little oasis. You can see the water erupting from nothing, and the water here is incredibly cool, clean, and refreshing. There are lots of boulders to sit on.\n\nFrom here, it's a short hike to the fork up to the falls. The trail up to the falls viewpoint is not particularly steep, but much of it is just waking on volcanic debris, and it is harder than it looks. The end of the trail is marked by a large rock pile, and the view of the falls from here, as well as the surrounding gorge are unforgettable. You also have views of the top of Mt Rainier, and Johnston ridge from here.\n\nThe walk back down to the main trail is much easier, and there is the chance of spotting mountain goats.\n\nThe rest of the return trip is really not much easier than the trip in, because you still are dipping in and out of runoff channels. That said, you are facing spirit lake, and the views continue to boggle the mind. Mount Adams is your constant companion for the last segments of the hike, and taking the time to appreciate the geologic history laid bare in the naked rocks is a great way to kill time. Along the road for the last couple of miles, you can see layers of pumice from multiple eruptions over the centuries, and, and the spectacular colors of the rock comprising the surrounding valleys.", "duration_minutes": 212, "duration_minutes_hiking": 212, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 106, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 78, "duration_minutes_cycling": 60, "objectID": "trail-10029565"}, {"ID": 10234594, "slug": "trail/us/washington/south-tiger-mountain-trail", "popularity": 16.7347, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 47.4432, "lng": -121.97666}, "length": 11104.446, "elevation_gain": 468.7824, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "L", "visitor_usage": "3", "avg_rating": 4.0, "area_id": 10129071, "area_slug": "parks/us/washington/tiger-mountain-state-forest", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 3933, "state_id": 48, "verified_map_id": 20420473, "activities": ["hiking", "nature-trips", "trail-running", "horseback-riding"], "profile_photo_data": "47440305-7e4cf86769d7ade75c2bf39a4eaf61ae", "num_reviews": 675, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 717, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1560793990, "name": "South Tiger Mountain Loop", "city_name": "Issaquah", "state_name": "Washington", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Tiger Mountain State Forest", "duration_minutes": 215, "duration_minutes_hiking": 215, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 108, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 79, "duration_minutes_cycling": 61, "objectID": "trail-10234594"}, {"ID": 10029029, "slug": "trail/us/washington/bells-mountain-trail", "popularity": 16.7318, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 45.75926, "lng": -122.33958}, "length": 25749.44, "elevation_gain": 902.8176000000001, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10121296, "area_slug": "parks/us/washington/moulton-falls-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 9164, "state_id": 48, "verified_map_id": 87579551, "activities": ["hiking", "mountain-biking", "horseback-riding"], "profile_photo_data": "20560500-23daccf4a6e3acefebc0b8e89490153d", "num_reviews": 386, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 1161, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1533416749, "name": "Bells Mountain Trail", "city_name": "Yacolt", "state_name": "Washington", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Moulton Falls Park", "description": "Part of this trail area is shut Monday through Friday for logging.\n\nFrom Moulton Falls, the trail begins with a one mile steep incline through lush forest.

Coming from the south you'll see a sign for Deception Pass State Park. Turn left into the park and follow the signs to Little North Beach .... After you've spent some time on the beach watching the currents and tide, head back out to the main road and continue north. Just across the main bridge, you'll encounter a parking area on the right.

It is a great park right in the middle of West Seattle.\n\nLincoln Park is West Seattle's major multi-purpose park - a nose-shaped bluff on Puget Sound just north of the Fauntleroy Ferry Terminal. Switchbacks on the north and gentle trails to the south connect a mile of sea-walled, rocky beaches to a bluff of grassy forests and meadows with play and picnic areas galore. Amazingly diverse for its size, Lincoln includes 4.6 miles of walking paths, 3.9 miles of bike trails, five picnic areas, playing fields, and an outdoor heated saltwater pool and bathhouse.\n\nAccessibility: There are 4 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of Fauntleroy Way Southwest at the west end of the trail. All of them are van-accessible with striped access aisles. The trail surface is paved asphalt, concrete, or a natural surface (dirt). It is typically at least 5 feet wide. \n\nThe most accessible portion of the trail is the first about 0.5 miles when going counterclockwise. The majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category and the steepest sections are at about 0.9 to 1.2 miles when going counterclockwise.

It is van-accessible with striped access aisles. The trail surface is packed gravel, paved asphalt, or natural dirt surface and typically at least 3 feet wide. The most accessible portion of the trail is the first about 0.8 miles on the packed gravel road to the overlook over Woodard Bay. \n\nThe estimated grade is mostly gentle (5% or less), with some moderately steep (5-8%) sections at about 0.1 miles uphill and 0.4 miles downhill when going counterclockwise. After about 0.8 miles the trail turns to natural dirt, which might be narrow, and there are some stairs along the route. On the first 0.8 miles, trail goers using wheelchair/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the moderately steeper sections or to avoid them for safety.

Discover the plants and animals that call this area their home, including deer, birds, and beavers.\n\nAccessibility: There are at least 4 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of Paradise Road at the south end of the trail by the National Park Inn and Longmire Museum. All of the parking spots are van-accessible with striped access aisles. There are wheelchair-accessible restrooms next to the museum. The trail surface is asphalt, wooden bridge, or gravel (with partial railings), and typically at least 3 feet wide. \n\nThe most accessible portion of the trail is the southern half of the route according to the National Park Service. The estimated grade is mostly gentle (5% or less) except for steep to very steep (over 8%) uphill and downhill sections from about 0.2 through 0.4 miles when going counterclockwise. Trail goers/hikers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the steeper sections or to avoid them for safety. All-terrain tires or motorized equipment may be needed for the unpaved and uneven sections. There are benches and picnic tables along portions of the route for resting.

Several unspoiled lakes filled with trout, blue waters that are unmatched for sparkling clarity, and surrounded with barren slopes all, with their own character that make each lake unmistakable.  \n\nFrom the trailhead, the first part of the trail seems to be walking up an old stream bed, very rocky and loose. After about a 1000ft or so, it becomes more trail like, and then follows the West Fork Foss River for awhile, giving you views of the surrounding sheer rock face that lines the river here. Once you reach the river crossing, you will notice that you have to follow rock cairns, as the river washed out this part of trail. At the point that you need to cross the river, it will be over a log that has a step nailed into it on the opposite side, making it easier to step down, or up. From here, pay close attention, as the continuing trail here is not well marked! \n\nThe trail begins again about another 50 feet or so, on your right. Back on the trail, it continues on towards Trout Lake through old growth fir, cedar and hemlock, and the trail is easy to follow here. There are several campsites here, along the banks of the lake, and further back into the woods. From Trout Lake on, it starts getting steep, at about 2.6 miles in. Eventually, you break out into the open, and you can see a huge waterfall cascading down barren rock. This waterfall runs out of Copper Lake, the next lake you\u2019ll see on this hike. The open here is traversed with switchbacks through scrub brush, and it\u2019s steep. You\u2019ll gain 1800 feet of elevation in 1.5 miles. This is not a section of trail that you want to do in the midday sun, so if you can, avoid that\u2026If you go during the heat of the day, there is a small stream at the top of the switchbacks, that will be a good source of water, and a place to cool down, as it\u2019s in the shade. Once you reach this point, the hard part is behind you.\n\nAt the Malachite Lake trail junction, you\u2019re at 4.17 miles, and the uphill is more gradual, and at 4.4 miles, you reach Copper Lake, another beautiful  subalpine lake surrounded on three sides by steep, barren slopes, interspersed with clingy alpine firs. The lake walk itself rises and falls with the terrain, and there are several great viewpoints and a few campsites at the Northern end of the lake. The trail along the lake goes .7 miles over and around some jumbled boulders before you start your uphill once again at the southern end of Copper Lake. The trail is still good here, and in .5 miles, you\u2019ll find yourself at the edge of Little Heart Lake. A small, circular lake that you really have to get off trail to see well, you can see it through the trees from where you\u2019re at, but to take pictures, you\u2019ll have to walk over to its banks. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anywhere to camp here, at least that could be seen from the trail. Continuing uphill to your final destination at Big Heart Lake, you find that once again, you\u2019re steadily going up. Another 760 feet, to be exact, and it\u2019s a rugged trail, but along the way, you\u2019ll have spectacular views of the deep valley to the East, over your left shoulder, towards Mt. Baker, Delta Lake down below you, and Silver Eagle Peak sitting above Delta Lake. At the high point of this ridge, it\u2019s rocky, and dry. After you\u2019ve topped out at 4935ft, you\u2019ll drop back down to the edge of Big Heart Lake, at 4162 ft elevation. A spectacular deep blue lake, surrounded by barren peaks, still adorned in small snow fields, and sparse alpine firs. Its outlet creates a long sloping falls that helps to cool you on hot days. The lake itself is warm enough to swim in, and it also is a refreshing way to end a hike. If you bring your trout pole, there is ample fishing, as well. There are a few good campsites here at the Northern edge of the lake, and they are close to the water\u2019s edge. Further in, and up beyond a small meadow covered in low lying blueberries to a site that was perched overlooking the lake, where you are able to take in all its\u2019 beauty. A little further from water, but the views were spectacular. You can look left, and see the lake and surrounding peaks, and look right, and see Mt. Baker in the distance, across several smaller hills and valleys. There is, from here, another hikers trail that heads off towards Angeline Lake, that lies just over the ridgeline, that does not show up on some maps.\n\nPermit required for overnight camping.", "duration_minutes": 490, "duration_minutes_hiking": 490, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 245, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 179, "duration_minutes_cycling": 139, "objectID": "trail-10331326"}, {"ID": 10241407, "slug": "trail/us/washington/peabody-creek-trail", "popularity": 13.907, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 48.09956, "lng": -123.42633}, "length": 8368.568, "elevation_gain": 288.9504, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.0, "area_id": 10106825, "area_slug": "parks/us/washington/olympic-national-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 6590, "state_id": 48, "verified_map_id": 50991789, "activities": ["hiking", "trail-running", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "11249880-39c448534eebfdda438fe4f87ca1ae28", "num_reviews": 375, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 292, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1504662015, "name": "Peabody Creek Trail", "city_name": "Port Angeles", "state_name": "Washington", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Olympic National Park", "description": "Peabody creek trail has a half mile loop at the bottom, but it connects to a three mile out and back that ends on Hurricane Ridge road.

This is an easy hike in an area of rugged, steep country and one of the few that are suitable for small children. It is an especially pretty hike in the fall when the larch are turning golden.\n\nThe hike starts out by crossing a nice sturdy bridge built to take both hikers and horses across Cutthroat Creek. Once across, the trail then veers away from the creek as it heads toward the lake. A wide and mostly level trail takes you through the open forest. Notice the thin gray trunked subalpine firs and the sparse understory. Since it is east of the Cascade crest, it is drier than the wooded areas to the west. It is interesting to note the two species of pines growing here together. Both have bundles of five needles, which helps identify them. One is western white pine, it has long soft gray green needles, and usually found growing more to the west. The other is whitebark pine, it generally grows in dry soil at high elevations and has greener needles that are more waxy. On more exposed ridges, whitebark pine would be found exclusively, much smaller and in a more contorted shape.\n\nAs you approach a more open area, views of Cutthroat Peak and Cutthroat Ridge can be seen ahead of you to the left. In 1.7 miles come to a junction with the Cutthroat Pass trail heading up to meet the Pacific Crest trail at Cutthroat Pass. Your path to the lake is to the left. Follow it down toward the lake, cross a log footbridge across a creek and meet the lake in 0.2 miles. There is no established trail around the lake, but it is possible to spread out along the grassy lakeshore.\n\nEat a sandwich and admire the view of the ridge with the unusual golden rock, and in fall, golden larch to match. Enjoy the quiet here, just on the other side of the ridge lies Washington Pass and the busy North Cascades highway.\n\nExtending your hike: This is just the beginning of a varied and scenic hike to Cutthroat Pass. The pass is 3.8 miles further and 1900 feet higher, but worth the extra effort, the views from the ridge are stupendous! Bring four people, have two start north on the PCT at the Rainy Pass trailhead, and two start at the Cutthroat Lake trailhead. Meet on the top of the ridge at Cutthroat Pass, have lunch together, then pass the car keys. You can also combine this hike with a hike into Blue Lake just a few miles west of Washington Pass.", "duration_minutes": 95, "duration_minutes_hiking": 95, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 48, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 35, "duration_minutes_cycling": 27, "objectID": "trail-10272253"}, {"ID": 10006172, "slug": "trail/us/washington/mazama-ridge-trail-to-faraway-rock", "popularity": 13.4634, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 46.78704, "lng": -121.73503}, "length": 8368.568, "elevation_gain": 360.8832, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "3", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10106823, "area_slug": "parks/us/washington/mount-rainier-national-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 6251, "state_id": 48, "verified_map_id": 13467851, "activities": ["hiking", "snowshoeing"], "profile_photo_data": "23309590-2a4fb3ba0cfa83eaa1d428f4d53e05d8", "num_reviews": 67, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 3152, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1504226156, "name": "Mazama Ridge Trail to Faraway Rock", "city_name": "Paradise Inn", "state_name": "Washington", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Mount Rainier National Park", "duration_minutes": 164, "duration_minutes_hiking": 164, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 82, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 60, "duration_minutes_cycling": 47, "objectID": "trail-10006172"}, {"ID": 10433090, "slug": "trail/us/washington/three-corners-rock", "popularity": 13.4558, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 45.74904, "lng": -122.04328}, "length": 6115.492, "elevation_gain": 332.8416, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10176075, "area_slug": "parks/us/washington/yacolt-burn-state-forest", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 7866, "state_id": 48, "verified_map_id": 23937474, "activities": ["hiking", "nature-trips"], "profile_photo_data": "24290970-4b0b1dffaa4b066d8539bccb8bee82f8", "num_reviews": 254, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 200, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1560952785, "name": "Three Corners Rock", "city_name": "Stevenson", "state_name": "Washington", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Yacolt Burn State Forest", "description": "The views are incredible on this hike on a clear day you can see Mt.

In total, the Cedar River trail is almost 18 miles long. The first about 12 miles are paved and the last 5 are dirt.\n\nAccessibility: There is 1 designated accessible space in the paved parking lot off of Nishiwaki Lane at the north end of the trail. It is van-accessible with striped access aisles. Additionally, there are 4 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of 149th Avenue at Ron Regis Park at about 4.7 miles. All of them are van-accessible with striped access aisles. This parking lot has been marked with a waypoint. \n\nThe trail surface is paved asphalt or a natural surface (dirt). It is typically at least 6 feet wide. There is a painted dividing line along some of the trail which reduces the width. The most accessible portion of the trail is the paved portion in the first about 12 miles. \n\nThe majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category and the steepest sections are at about 6.8, 12.2, and 13.8 miles when going south. Trail goers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the steeper sections or to avoid them for safety.

in the Lost Valley Creek. The trail on your left is your return route. These trails are in excellent shape thanks to the volunteer work of the Back-country Horsemen (and women) of Washington. \n\nHead right on Trail No. 20. Climbing gradually, pass a few big firs, a lot of skunk cabbage, and an active beaver pond. In 1.4 miles come to a junction with Trail No. 6, the Green Line ( It will say Green Line as soon as you cross the Logging Road). Turn left and follow this good trail. Climb a bit more, and after crossing a logging road enter a mature second-growth forest. Begin a long descent into the Sherman Creek valley. At 2.6 miles emerge from the forest to cross a recent cut. Notice the temperature change. Notice Capitol Peak and Larch Mountain in front of you. \n\nAt 3.25 miles reach the lovely Sherman Creek valley, where you'll come to another trail junction. The trail right crosses the creek (bridge out as of summer 2006) and heads to the Fall Creek trailhead and onward to the Capitol Crest. You'll want to continue left for an enjoyable journey down the valley. Plenty of lunch spots along the way will entice you to take a break. \n\nAfter about 3 miles of hiking along the creek you'll come to an old trail junction. There used to be a trailhead on the other side of the creek, but it and the road no longer exist. This decommissioning has helped return a little solitude to this region. The trail now leaves Sherman Creek to follow Lost Valley Creek upstream. This is the best part of the loop. Under a canopy of moss-draped alders and big cedars, the trail uses an old logging railroad bed. After 1 mile of heading up Lost Valley Creek, look for trestle remnants. Look, too, along the creek for relics from the old logging days. Broken bricks and porcelain plates litter the area. Be sure to leave these artifacts for others to enjoy.

clockwise or counter-clockwise. You first witness the picturesque Myrtle Falls, walk through gorgeous meadows with wildflowers and the incredible Mount Rainier in the backdrop. After the paved paths, the trail will get drastically more challenging, taking you through some steep switchbacks, up to some rocky cliffs at the peak before making the loop down via the Skyline Trail. \n\nOn the way down, they'll be multiple look-out spots that provides jaw-dropping views of Mount Rainier and the layers of mountain ridges in the distance. Along the way they'll be plenty of marmots and mountain goats. The last stretch of the loop is a nice downhill slope with paved routes and you'll end at the Paradise Inn.

After ascending through thick forest the first 1-1/2 miles, a plateau full of huckleberry fields and hundreds of small lakes that beg exploring.\n\nIndian Heaven Wilderness is famous for its 150 + lakes and huckleberry-filled alpine meadows. The Native Americans used to gather each year to hunt, fish, collect berries and race their horses until the 1920s. On the northern and western side of the wilderness, huckleberry picking is still reserved for tribal members only. On clear days, there are great views of Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, Goat Rocks and Mount St. Helens.\r\n\r\nStarting at the Cultus Creek campground, the hike begins a steep ascent through a Douglas Fir forest and skirts along the side of Bird Mountain. The first viewpoint has a very big payoff: unobstructed views of nearby Mount Adams, with Goat Rocks and Mount Rainier in the not so far distance.

leads through the forest to a big overlook deck with benches. After about 0.2 miles, the trail turns into a natural surface and continues onto the River Loop Trail. Keep an eye out for salmon spawning at the river. For a longer trip, you can connect to Loops A or B at the campground from this trail. Pets must be on a leash.\n\nAccessibility: There are 2 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of Highway 20 at the south end of the trail. Both of them are van-accessible with striped access aisles. The trail surface is a wooden boardwalk with edge barriers or a natural surface (dirt, rocks, roots). It is typically at least 2 feet wide.\n\nThe most accessible portion of the trail is the wooden boardwalk in the first about 0.3 miles. The majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category and the steepest sections are at about 0.3-0.4 miles when going north. All-terrain tires or motorized equipment may be needed for the surface type and grade after about 0.3 miles. \n\nThere are benches along the route for resting. According to the park website, the North Cascades Visitor Center and the restrooms are wheelchair-accessible.

From the information kiosk walk forward and keep left at the trailhead marker. The trail is very wide when compared to its connecting trails, but it is composed of a mixture of large and small rocks.\n\nThe trail is named after a mining town by the same name that existed in the late 1800's. The houses were mainly red, hence the name, and served as a railroad depot where coal was carted from the nearby mines to Lake Washington. Other than the houses there was a large hotel in the town which you can still see the boiler rooms foundation.\n\nThe trail is fairly easy to navigate, it is wide and other than a few bends in the road is fairly straight and level. As you walk up the trail you will be surrounded on both sides by large Douglas Firs. On the first half of the trail you will encounter many people, especially on sunny days, as the trail is the main route to many of the parks waterfalls. If you stay on the trail you will begin to see fewer people but that's not to say that there is nothing to see. If you are hiking in the Spring or Summer you can view some amazing wild flowers towards the end of the trail. After a few twists and turns you will come to a horse watering hole (this is closed in the winter due to freezing). To the right you will see a sign for the meadow restoration project. Following the path, you will shortly come to a gated area and a bench to rest your feet. There are several informational signs in the area that describe the local flora in the meadow. Now that you know what you are looking at enter one of the two gates and explore the short loop of wild flowers. Once done you can return to the trail from the route you took or cross a bridge just North of the meadow which will connect you to the Indian Trail.\n\nThis is the most frequently used trails on the west side of the park because of how many trails it connects to.

Thomas Lake is stocked with rainbow and brook trout. \n\nContinue on until you reach Blue Lake, which is on the PCT. Blue Lake has a very strong population of Western Slope Cutthroat. Spend the night at Blue Lake, then take the PCT to Lemei Lake Trail, then Indian Heaven Trail to Deep Lake. \n\nDeep Lake has a good view of Mt. Adams, and a strong population of Western Slope Cutthroat. Spend the night at Deep Lake, then backtrack down Indian Heaven Trail to the PCT, then Elk Lake Trail back to Elk Lake. \n\nElk Lake has a few fish, but Bear Lake has a much stronger population of Western Slope Cutthroat.

Not a hike per se but a great place to stretch your legs and take in the sights and sounds of Seattle's famous tourist destination. \n\nSeattle's famous Pike Place Market has been one of the city's most lively attractions since it opened in 1907. Today it is your one-stop-shop for seafood, meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, crafts, wines, souvenirs--you name it! It is no wonder why this world-famous market is commonly referred to as \"The Soul of Seattle.\"\n\nAround 1906 the price of onions in the city rose 10 times in price. Local citizens decided that enough was enough and they would try to cut out the middlemen to lower the prices and allow farmers to sell directly to consumers.\n\nOn August 17, 1907, eight farmers brought their goods for sale to the market's first opening where they were surprised by a crowd of over 10,000 people waiting for their produce. Within the first few hours, they sold everything and the market has been thriving ever since.\n\nToday it seems just as busy with over 10 million visitors every year from around the world.  Inside the market houses over 200 businesses and almost as many independent craftsmen, farmers, and street performers all trying to benefit and making a living from the throngs of people every day.\n\nAccessibility: There is at least 1 designated accessible space in the brick parking lot off of Pike Place at the east end of the trail. It is van-accessible with striped access aisles. The trail surface is paved asphalt, concrete, or bricks.  It is typically at least 5 feet wide. The majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category. This trail will likely be navigable for most wheelchairs/mobility equipment or stroller users.

During the winter, snowshoers and crosscountry skiers can still use the closed road.   \n\nWestside Road is one mile from the Nisqually Entrance, in the southwest corner of the park. Westside Road was originally envisioned as part of an \u201caround-the-mountain\u201d network of roads encircling Mount Rainier but was never completed. Frequent flooding and debris flows by Tahoma Creek closed all but the first three miles of the road to vehicles. \n\nThere is a small parking area at Dry Creek at the end of this three-mile section. From Dry Creek, the gravel road climbs to Round Pass, descends into the South Puyallup River Valley, then climbs to Klapatche Point, where the road terminates. From Dry Creek to Klapatche Pass, the road is 9.25 miles long with an elevation change of approximately 2,100 feet.\n\nPlease note that due to danger from rock fall, vehicles must park south of the barricade at Dry Creek. Hikers and bicyclists should travel through the area with caution and avoid lingering in the hazard zone. There are no restroom facilities along Westside Road. The closest comfort station is at Kautz Creek, approximately 5.5 miles from the Dry Creek parking lot on route to Longmire.

You will stroll along the Carbon Glacier and might be entertained by the always present Hoary Marmots.  As you near Mystic, the view of the meadows and the mountain are spectacular to say the least.  It makes the hard work worth it. You begin with a long uphill climb past Spray Falls and Eagle's Roost to the wonderful Spray Park.  Flowers abound and the scenery is magnificent.  Over the top and down past Seattle Park into the woods you will pass Cataract Valley camp on your way to the Carbon River suspension bridge. Fun and exciting to cross, it takes you over the lowest glacier in the U.S., The Carbon Glacier. Up you go again along the glacier to the beautiful meadows at Moraine Park. Just a bit more and you can see Mystic below you.  Once there, relax and have lunch.

It is also home to reptiles, amphibians, and native plant populations.\n\nThe central feature of the Tacoma Nature Center is the 17-acre serpentine-shaped lake and wetland. The lake is home to the spectacularly colored wood duck, which frequently is seen at the first bridge. Mallards and Canadian geese are common year-round residents. The plants and animals that live here are representative of those that share life with us in an urban environment. For the health of the ducks and geese, please refrain from feeding them.\n\nAccessibility: There are 2 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of South Tyler Street at the north end of the trail. Both of them are van-accessible with striped access aisles. The trail surface is a wooden boardwalk with railings or gravel. It is typically at least 4 feet wide.\n\nThe most accessible portion of the trail is the first about 0.3 miles. The majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category but there are steeper sections are at about 0.4-0.6 and 1.0-1.1 miles when going clockwise. There appear to be stairs at about 0.3 miles. Trail goers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance at the stairs or to avoid them for safety.
