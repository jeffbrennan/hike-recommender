While this trail is not super long, users do recommend arriving earlier in the day to enjoy the natural landscape and its views, since the dense forest can get dark quite quickly if attempting near dusk. Overall, this trail is very straightforward and includes so much variety in terms of terrain and the sights along the way. At the middle of the hike, many trails converge together with three waterfalls in view which allows users to spread out and enjoy each one. There are many landmarks on the way up to artists rock so if users plan to come here please give enough time to enjoy all of them\n\nSince this trail is located within the Catskill Park, users may encounter an array of wild animals. Black Bear are common in the area, so bringing bear spray or hiking with a group is the safest way to remain distant from large animals. Deer, fox, coyote and wolf are also in the area, but less frequently seen and more kind to humans. During the shoulder seasons, users recommend wearing good shoes since the rock and trails can be slick. This is the time of year when winds are also strong, with 70mph wind gusts common along the ridges along the edge of trails. \n\nUsers do recommend downloading the offline trail maps since as the route ventures further into the forest, the trail markings can become less visible. If attempting during the spring, bug spray is a great idea as well, since this is prime bug season and users will appreciate being less bitten. This is also one of the busiest and most popular summer trails in the area, so getting out early is the best way to have the best experience.

Following this brief gentle section the trail steepens and continues mostly on bedrock to the summit.\n\nThe fire tower is open, but good views can be had without climbing it.

The most accessible portion of the trail is the first 0.5 miles. \n\nThe majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle grade category (5% or less) but there is a  steeper section from about 0.6 to 0.7 miles when going southbound. Hikers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the steeper section or to avoid it for safety. All-terrain tires or motorized equipment may be needed for the surface type and grade. There are benches and picnic tables along the route for resting. The visitor center is wheelchair-accessible.

After signing in at the trailhead at the far end of the parking lot, follow the path 1 mile. You'll see a trail intersection, marked, follow it to the right because that is your path to Wright Peak, Algonquin, Iroquois Peak. It is 2.6 miles to the summit of Wright. \n\nFor the first part up towards Wright, the rocks make a stairway which is pretty nice and easy to follow. You'll encounter some steep rocks but they are easy to get up. You can't miss the sign for Wright Peak (#16 on 46'er list), follow the trail left .4 miles to summit. On clear days you can see for miles in every direction. There is a plaque dedicated to Servicemen who's plane crashed into the mountain so search around for it. \n\nAfter you climb back down, keep heading up the trail about 30-40 minutes and you'll be on the summit of Algonquin (#2 on 46'er list). Very beautiful views. If you follow the summit you'll see cairns lining down the backside of Algonquin leading towards Iroquois Peak which is 1 mile. \n\nNow, after following the cairns down you'll see an arrow pointing left, do NOT take it. Go right. From here, the path is a very narrow. At one point, the rocks get steep and you'll have to climb part of it. Shorter people and children will have difficulties here. But once you make it over the first peak, Iroquois is the next one. Just keep following the trail and cairns and you'll make it. Once again more great views. \n\nOn the way back, you can follow that arrow and take it towards Avalanche Lake, and follow the signs to Marcy Dam and the Lodge or just back track the way you came.", "duration_minutes": 401, "duration_minutes_hiking": 401, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 200, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 146, "duration_minutes_cycling": 114, "objectID": "trail-10266176"}, {"ID": 10267567, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/glen-creek-gorge-trail", "popularity": 26.9572, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 42.37501, "lng": -76.87381}, "length": 2253.076, "elevation_gain": 119.7864, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "4", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10113993, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/watkins-glen-state-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 8700, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 73619336, "activities": ["hiking", "nature-trips"], "profile_photo_data": "37978711-d49e2fc87f4cc855b425c33f3ab4d961", "num_reviews": 1653, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 4868, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1555374272, "name": "Glen Creek Gorge Trail", "city_name": "Watkins Glen", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Watkins Glen State Park", "description": "Watkins Glen State Park in New York is one of the most well known parks of the Finger Lakes region.

Soon is another view, better than the first view with Gore Mountain as the main feature.

Up there is your final destination and it's only 0.4 miles away. There are still more overlooks as you continue your climb toward the summit, reaching the 2418 foot summit at 2.7 miles.

The pebble-lined Allens Creek enters the park as visitors do, through the vaulted stone arch of the railway bridge. It is this tunnel that gives visitors a feeling of entering another world; one that really shouldn't be here, as they leave the busy expressways and business complexes above, and follow Allens Creek as it winds around glacial formations and drops over several small frothy cascades. Tunnel Falls, lying just as the creek emerges from beneath the vine-covered stone of the rail bridge, is the first of many lovely scenes that is remembered long after leaving. Two additional cascades, although small in size, shake up the creek and provide a little excitement in this otherwise serene landscape.\n\nIn addition to the three cascades, the southern part of the park carries hikers around rolling glacial moraines left from the last ice age, wetland marsh that is as saturated with wildlife as it is with water, and a wind-swept meadow in the heart of it all. Being an oasis of green within an urban jungle, migrating birds often use the valley as a stop-over on their long journeys. Over 100 species have been spotted here.

The bridge's construction became a family affair, when Roebling fell ill and enlisted his adult son, Washington, to lead the project. Not long after Washington assumed the charge of the bridge did he also need to pass the baton after he suffered permanent physical damage while working in the sealed underwater foundations for the two towers (an ailment known as caisson disease, decompression sickness or more commonly \"the bends\"). Washington put his wife Emily in charge, and for more than a decade she managed the day-to-day operations of the bridge construction, bringing instructions from her bed-ridden husband to the job site and updates back to him. She became highly knowledgable about the engineering intricacies of the bridge, impressing politicians and other engineers with her capabilities and leadership. In the official opening ceremony, on May 24, 1883, Emily was the first person to cross the bridge.", "duration_minutes": 47, "duration_minutes_hiking": 47, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 23, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 17, "duration_minutes_cycling": 13, "objectID": "trail-10259500"}, {"ID": 10258741, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/balanced-rock", "popularity": 16.3414, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 44.21927, "lng": -73.88703}, "length": 5149.888, "elevation_gain": 283.7688, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10163546, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/sentinel-range-wilderness", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 4356, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 90467917, "activities": ["hiking", "nature-trips"], "profile_photo_data": "11740986-ac1a7bc3b8d034ee10f212f52cb4ca8d", "num_reviews": 486, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 954, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1551710333, "name": "Balanced Rock", "city_name": "Lake Placid", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Sentinel Range Wilderness", "description": "Took 5 boys up with the LP Outing Club.

Parking is along the road (just south of the intersection of US Route 9 and NY Route 301) that leads to Fahnestock Park\u2019s Hubbard Lodge. Google Maps can have difficulty locating the trailhead. Enter Hubbard Lodge in Google Maps to be sure the directions are correct.\n\nHead northeast on School Mountain Road (white blazes) which is co-aligned at that point with the Fahnestock Trail (blue blazes). You pass over a couple of (relatively new) bridges. At about 0.5 miles, you cross a bridge made of parallel steel I-beams, immediately after which the Fahnestock Trail turns right. Stay straight on School Mountain Road. The next \u201cbridge\u201d is a more rickety affair, a sort of horizontal ladder made of aluminum. [If you\u2019re balance-challenged, this can be a bit problematic, so consider taking the Hubbard Loop (yellow blazes) to the left where the Fahnestock Trail goes right. This adds about a quarter-mile compared to staying on School Mountain Road, but avoids this iffy bridge.] At about 1.5 miles, turn right onto the Round Hill Bypass Trail (green blazes). You start climbing a bit (through some occasionally wet areas). At about 2.5 miles, turn right onto the Fahnestock Trail (blue blazes), and begin a much steeper climb up the east side of Round Hill, the top of which you reach at about 2.8 miles. There are a couple of spots near the top where there are nice views, mainly to the southeast. You then descend the west side of Round Hill. At about 4 miles, the trail makes a right turn and flattens out considerably.

It is from tis point on that the hike is fairly incredible - the ridge hike allows you to summit three additional smaller mountains (Bald, Blueberry and Mason) while enjoying incredible views along the way and a walk through a picturesque lower forest.", "duration_minutes": 469, "duration_minutes_hiking": 469, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 234, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 171, "duration_minutes_cycling": 133, "objectID": "trail-10252044"}, {"ID": 10395483, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/diamond-notch-falls-via-spruceton-road", "popularity": 14.2522, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 42.18248, "lng": -74.26947}, "length": 2735.878, "elevation_gain": 67.9704, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10168690, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/hunter-west-kill-wilderness-area", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 8821, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 104431084, "activities": ["hiking", "nature-trips"], "profile_photo_data": "30336295-5c01014f252e58f93ac9cea36a9b1266", "num_reviews": 281, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 740, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1553809571, "name": "Diamond Notch Falls via Spruceton Road", "city_name": "West Kill", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Hunter-West Kill Wilderness Area", "duration_minutes": 43, "duration_minutes_hiking": 43, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 22, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 16, "duration_minutes_cycling": 12, "objectID": "trail-10395483"}, {"ID": 10325846, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/casino-fire-tower-scofield-ridge-lambs-hill-and-rainbow-falls-loop", "popularity": 14.2084, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 41.49264, "lng": -73.95955}, "length": 11426.314, "elevation_gain": 691.8960000000001, "difficulty_rating": "5", "route_type": "L", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10165616, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/mount-beacon-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 510, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 19775787, "activities": ["birding", "hiking", "nature-trips", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "11347680-da3b132659f9192a04f7abd5116cb00f", "num_reviews": 397, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 5391, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1578694151, "name": "Casino, Fire Tower, Scofield Ridge, Lambs Hill, and Rainbow Falls Loop", "city_name": "Beacon", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Mount Beacon Park", "description": "The City of Beacon offers a Free Loop Bus that takes hikers from the Metro North Train Station to the Mount Beacon Casino, Fire Tower, Scofield Ridge, Lambs Hill, and Rainbow Falls Loop Trail Head.

Beacon Park, but quickly leaves to spend most of the time/miles in Hudson Highlands State Park.  Along its route, you pass by/through several historic areas (incline railway, casino, and the Mt. Beacon fire tower, as well as a number of places with marvelous views in every possible direction.  An added bonus is a cascade water fall.  Along the way are sections which are quite steep as well as others which are relatively flat.\n\nFrom the parking lot at Mt. Beacon Park, you pick up the Casino Trail (red), passing the lower terminus of the incline railway which, in the first half of the 20th century, took tourists to the casino near the top of the mountain.  The trail uses a set of stairs to climb an initial steep section, and then proceeds via a number of washed-out old ski trails, leading to the ruins of the casino complex, which, together with the adjacent brick building which houses the machinery used to hoist the incline railway, is well worth a visit, both for its historic importance as well as for the great views to be had to the north and west from the site.  You then continue on the Casino Trail (which now follows a washed-out dirt road), for the most part climbing gently, until you reach the intersection with the Breakneck Ridge Trail (white).  Turn right onto the latter, which climbs moderately steeply to the summit of South Beacon Mountain, the site of the Beacon fire tower.  Even if you don\u2019t choose to climb the tower, the panoramic view from this spot is stupendous, not least the New York City skyline to the south.  Return down the Breakneck Ridge Trail (make sure you\u2019re going to the north!) until its end at the Casino Trail (red), where you turn right onto the latter.  In about 0.25 miles, the Casino Trail ends (though the road it has been following continues!) where it intersects with the Wilkinson Trail (yellow), onto which you turn left.  The Wilkinson Trail then proceeds along Scofield Ridge, with several spots where you once again have good views of NYC, as well as some later viewpoints to the east.  It descends from Scofield Ridge on an old woods road.  At a T-junction, although the Wilkinson Trail turns right, you turn left onto an unnamed trail (blue).  Stay on this trail through several twists and turns until it ends at what is called Dozer Junction (because of the presence of a long-abandoned bulldozer), at which point you turn left onto the Fishkill Ridge Trail (white) to make the fairly short ascent of Lambs Hill.  Shortly after the actual summit, you reach an open area which has a fabulous view to the north and west.  You then make the fairly steep descent from Lambs Hill, eventually crossing a wide dirt road.  Continue on the Fishkill Ridge Trail as it continues descending, initially along an unnamed stream, then along Dry Brook.  At the point where the unnamed stream empties into Dry Brook, look uphill to your left for the picturesque Rainbow Falls (a cascade falls).  Then continue on the trail, which quickly crosses Dry Brook (interesting in high-water periods!).  About 0.15 miles past this ford, take the unnamed trail (yellow) which goes diagonally off to the left.  Continue on this trail (which eventually ends up using old ski trails) until it ends at the Casino Trail (red), which you then take downhill back to your starting point.", "duration_minutes": 266, "duration_minutes_hiking": 266, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 133, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 97, "duration_minutes_cycling": 75, "objectID": "trail-10325846"}, {"ID": 10030198, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/old-croton-aqueduct-trail-from-yonkers", "popularity": 14.2048, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 40.93537, "lng": -73.90228}, "length": 74029.64, "elevation_gain": 634.8984, "difficulty_rating": "1", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "3", "avg_rating": 4.0, "area_id": null, "area_slug": "", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 9184, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 25273207, "activities": ["birding", "hiking", "mountain-biking", "road-biking", "trail-running", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "30115829-e153dbb9650d893fcc2eb70650c3ed19", "num_reviews": 265, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 464, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1578529561, "name": "Old Croton Aqueduct Trail from Yonkers", "city_name": "Yonkers", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "duration_minutes": 913, "duration_minutes_hiking": 913, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 456, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 334, "duration_minutes_cycling": 259, "objectID": "trail-10030198"}, {"ID": 10273389, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/north-beacon-mountain-and-dar-monument-via-casino-trail", "popularity": 14.185, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 41.49335, "lng": -73.96026}, "length": 5954.558, "elevation_gain": 398.9832, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "3", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10174352, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/hudson-highlands-state-park-preserve", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 510, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 21944619, "activities": ["hiking", "nature-trips", "trail-running", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "20997015-9a8d0236b2db899a3ef4bcfad275bb2f", "num_reviews": 369, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 1907, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1556574196, "name": "North Beacon Mountain and DAR Monument via Casino Trail", "city_name": "Beacon", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Hudson Highlands State Park Preserve", "description": "The City of Beacon offers a Free Loop Bus that takes hikers from the Metro North Train Station to the North Beacon Mountain and DAR Monument via Casino Trail Head.

The dam will be the start and end of the loop. Make sure to use bear canisters as black bears frequent the area, if you plan on spending the night. From here you want to head out on the trail towards Avalanche Pass which you will leave before you actually reach Avalanche Pass. You will come to a trail junction and head towards Lake Arnold on the east side of Mt. Colden. There will be a trail heading off to your left to Indian Falls. Ignore it and keep heading towards Lake Arnold. \n\nWhen you reach Lake Arnold you'll see the trail heading up Colden. Disregard this and start heading downhill from Lake Arnold until you meet up with the Feldspar Brook Trail that will bring you up to Lake Tear of the Clouds between all the summits. This is the start of the Hudson River and also the start of Gray Peak. There are a few cairns that marks the trail for Gray Peak (#9 on 46'er list) so be sure to keep you eyes peeled for it. The hike up is steep and there is some hard hand over hand climbing so take your time. It only takes about 25-30 miles to the summit. From there you can see Mt Marcy and Mt Skylight and several others.\n\nOnce you're back down, keep heading down the trail to 4 corners. From there, turn right heading up Mt Skylight (#4 on 46'er list) which is about another 20-30 minutes to the bald summit. More amazing views from there so take your time and enjoy. Climb back down the way you came and now you can climb up the back side of Mt. Marcy. Once you are past the tree line it can be very windy and cold so be ready. You're now on top of the tallest mountain in New York at 5,344ft (#1 on 46'er list). Once you've taken all the pictures and videos of the most amazing views you'll see, don't back track. Head toward the Von Hoevenberg Trail towards Indian Falls / Marcy Dam. Indian Falls is a short trek off the main trail but a good resting spot. Keep heading towards Marcy Dam and then back to the lodge.", "duration_minutes": 583, "duration_minutes_hiking": 583, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 292, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 213, "duration_minutes_cycling": 165, "objectID": "trail-10255952"}, {"ID": 10325186, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/stony-kill-falls--2", "popularity": 13.133, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 41.73067, "lng": -74.29814}, "length": 1609.34, "elevation_gain": 63.7032, "difficulty_rating": "1", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10160468, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/minnewaska-state-park-preserve", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 4155, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 92205874, "activities": ["birding", "hiking", "nature-trips", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "43594910-1a6c75d3573a0273f4fd00e0f6e38da3", "num_reviews": 283, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 498, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1570567518, "name": "Stony Kill Falls", "city_name": "Kerhonkson", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Minnewaska State Park Preserve", "description": "This is a quiet and beautiful nice easy hike, mostly flat to the falls.

You then follow the latter trail to near the summit of Bald Hill, after which you descend by way of some woods roads, an unnamed white-blazed trail, and the Overlook Trail again. Along the initial part of the hike, there are good views to the north and west once you gain some elevation. The views from the Fishkill Ridge Trail are quite spectacular, with several spots where the New York City skyline is visible.\n\nOn the way down, you pass the (marked) site of an airplane wreck. The terrain along the route varies from steep to relatively level. There is a parking area just off the end of Sunnyside Road in the Town of Fishkill. From the parking area, walk around a fence and past a bulletin board, then make a U-turn to the right to start on the Overlook Trail (red). At about 0.4 miles, stay straight where a white-blazed trail starts off to the left (leading to Malouf\u2019s Mountain Camp, a private campground). At about 0.9 miles, you start to get a view to the northwest (leaves permitting), including the Fishkill Correctional Facility and the Hudson River. \n\nIn a while there are a few more, unobstructed views to the northwest, now including the Mid-Hudson Bridge and the Catskill Mountains. There is a viewpoint to the west at about 1.2 miles from which you can see Beacon in the foreground, then the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, Newburgh (including Stewart Airport), and the Shawangunk Ridge in the background. At about 1.8 miles the Overlook Trail ends, at which point (which also has a nice view) you should turn left onto the Fishkill Ridge Trail (white) which eventually begins a steep ascent leading, at about 2.2 miles to a clearing near the top of Lambs Hill, with not only views to the north, west, and southwest, but also plenty of low-bush blueberries in season. \n\nContinuing onward, you reach the top of Lambs Hill, after which you descend (with a pitch varying from mild to moderately steep) to reach Dozer Junction at 2.4 miles, where you cross a woods road (a blue-blazed trail starts to the right) at a spot where a bulldozer has been abandoned. Shortly thereafter there are a couple of limited views to the southeast. At about 2.6 miles you reach a point from which you get a good view to the south (Hudson River and the top of the New York City skyline). About 0.5 miles later you reach another spot with views to the south (now including Lake Valhalla in the foreground, the Hudson River, the Bear Mountain Bridge, and the New York City skyline). Continuing along, the trail reaches a clearing from which you get views to the east (Route 9, the various rock quarries along it, and the former IBM-East Fishkill plant to the northeast) and, shortly thereafter, a bit of the Hudson River to the west. \n\nAfter a series of ups and downs, you reach the top of Bald Hill, where there is a short detour to the right for a viewpoint (\"view\" is painted on the rock) to the south (including the New York City skyline) and the southeast. This makes a great rest stop. Returning to the main trail, continue north for 35 yards, then turn left off the Fishkill Ridge Trail onto a woods road on which the descent is alternately moderately steep and just plain steep. At 4.2 miles you will notice some flags and a couple of posters to the left of the trail which relate the story of the 1945 crash of a plane piloted by a World War II hero (Dixie Kiefer). There are a few pieces of the plane still scattered around the area. In another 0.3 miles, stay straight at an intersection with an unnamed white-blazed trail.

There are plenty of ups and downs along the way, some of them moderately steep, with views of some old iron mine workings, several lakes/ponds and a few stream crossings.  [If desired, this loop can be divided into 2 separate hikes: (1) start at NY Rte 301 and do the \"top\" of the figure-8 (2.5 miles) or (2) start at Dennytown Rd and do the \"bottom\" of the figure-8 (5.3 miles).]\n\nPark in a parking area on the west side of NY Route 301.  Cross the road and climb over the guardrail to reach the northern trailhead of the 3-Lakes Trail (blue).  In about 0.1 mile, the trail angles to the left to join an old mine road, with a number of artifacts of the old Philips Mine right next to the trail (and there are many more on the ridge to the right).  The road continues to the south, with a large swamp to the right.  At 0.75 miles, the 3-Lakes Tr leaves this road and turns right, with a stream crossing (on boulders) at the 1 mile point, followed by a moderate climb to an intersection with the Appalachian Trail (white) at 1.3 miles, at which point you stay on the 3-Lakes Tr which continues with some ups and downs, passing Hidden Lake (1.6 miles), the Old Mine RR trailhead (1.9 miles), and the Charcoal Burners trailhead (2.4 miles).  Shortly after the last of these, the trail turns right onto another old mine road, only to leave it after a short distance, with the collapsed bridge of the road to your right. The trail turns to the left as you approach the dam forming John Allen Pond, and you then descend to a stream crossing (with a small waterfall to the right), and climb up to Sunk Mine Road, where the trail turns right.  At 3.1 miles, the trail turns left off this road and begins a moderate ascent.  At 3.4 miles, the trail turns to the right. (If you want to explore the Denny Mine, turn left here - the southernmost workings of the mine are visible from the trail.)  You then descend (steeply for a few short sections,) to parallel the north shore of a swampy area, after which you make a slight  ascent to reach the southern terminus of the 3-Lakes Tr at a parking area/field on Dennytown Road at 2.9 miles. Stay on the east side of this field for about 75 yards and turn left onto the Appalachian Trail.  After paralleling the south side of the swamp, at 4.3 miles, you begin a moderate ascent/descent which leads to another intersection with the Sunk Mine Rd at 5.4 miles, where the AT jogs right, then almost immediately left.  You cross a tributary of Canopus Creek (where you will get wet feet in high-water conditions), with a small waterfall to the right, then begin a short, but steep climb up to a ridge, only to descend fairly steeply after 0.3 miles. (In leaf-down conditions, you can see a mine dump from the Sunk Mine cascading down the ridge to your left.)  You cross a level (frequently wet) area and then hit a short, steep descent followed by a moderately steep ascent, passing a vertical mine shaft on the right side of the trail at 6.3 miles. At the top of the climb, you reach the intersection with the 3-Lakes Trail, and go straight to stay on the AT.  At 6.7 miles, the AT angles to the right to travel on the old bed of the Sunk Mine Railroad.  At. 7.4 miles, angle to the right onto the old bed of the present Rte 301, which parallels the new road, for about 175 yards.

On the other hand, particularly near the top of Round Hill, you get some really nice vistas. East Mountain also provides views to the north, but it must be said that these are getting less nice with the years, as trees now partially block the views. You also can re-visit the farming community which existed along School Mountain Road, with innumerable stone fences and some ruins. \n\nThere are a number of bridges along this road which, unfortunately, have the bad habit of getting washed out, so be prepared! Park at the Hubbard Lodge and take a short connector trail which ends at the combined School Mountain Road (white)/Fahnestock Trails (blue), which follow a fairly level old road. At 0.4 miles, turn sharply right (immediately after a bridge) to stay on the Fahnestock Trail, which stays fairly level until it abruptly turns left to ascend Round Hill. Just before you get to the top, there is a nice vista to the north/northwest, with a view to the south just after the summit. At the bottom of the subsequent descent, the Fahnestock Trail joins the Round Hill Bypass Tr (green) for a short stretch. You then go up and down several times along a ridge. At 3.8 miles, turn left at the intersection with the Perkins Trail (yellow), which you follow as it descends to School Mtn Road. (On this stretch, there are many zigzags through stone fences, so keep an eye out for the blazes.) \n\nAlong the way, there is a cascade waterfall to your right. At 4.3 miles, turn right onto School Mtn Rd, cross a stream, and then immediately turn left onto East Mountain Loop (red) which initially follows an old road (with truly impressive stone fences and barn foundations) before cutting to the left at 4.6 miles to ascend East Mountain. Near the top (5 miles), there are somewhat occluded views to the north of Breakneck Ridge/Mt. Beacon), after which you descend fairly steeply back to School Mountain Road, near the bottom passing through another area rich in a maze of stone fences.

The route is laid out as a couple of loops connected by out-and-back segments. There are a couple of moderate hills along the way, but it is overall a fairly easy walk along what are in essence dirt carriage roads. Start at the parking lot on Springtown Road and head west, passing through rolling farm fields (with frequent views of the Gunks and Mohonk's Sky Top Tower). After crossing Butterville Road, you enter the Mohonk Preserve, shortly thereafter following Lenape Lane for a stretch. Where Lenape Lane makes a sharp left turn, instead turn right onto White Oak Bend Path, at the end of which, you again turn right, this time onto Pine Road, with this loop ending back at Butterville Road. In about 0.3 miles, stay right on a farm road that loops back to join the other leg of the R2R Trail to return to the parking area. If you choose to go further into the Mohonk Preserve, be aware that there is a day-use fee charged.\n\nAccessibility: There do not appear to be any designated accessible spaces in the gravel parking lot off of Springtown Road at the east end of the trail. There do not appear to be any designated accessible parking spaces within 1.0 miles of the trailhead. The trail surface is gravel. It is typically at least 8 feet wide. \n\nThe majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category but there are steeper sections at about 0.8-0.9, 1.8, 2.4, 3.6-3.7, and 4.8 miles when going clockwise. Trail goers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the steeper sections or to avoid them for safety. All-terrain tires or motorized equipment may be needed for the surface type and grade.

The trail is generally well defined and marked with orange diamonds or orange ribbon in a few spots.

At approximately 0.75 of a mile the trail makes a sharp left onto a less wide but still well defined path through the woods. \n\nOne does have to cross four tributaries to the Poestenkill but they are narrow and stepping stones can be found to cross over dryly. The trail comes to the Poestenkill opposite the southern terminus of the Creek Trail and then climbs a ridge alongside of the stream. While glimpses of the falls can be seen from the trail, hemlocks block a clear view.\n\nFor more information, please visit https://www.rensselaerplateau.org/barbervillefalls.", "duration_minutes": 52,

Both ascent and descent are plenty steep in spots (so you\u2019ll get some good cardio exercise!), but the only rock-scrambling is in just one spot - a short climb on the Breakneck Ridge Trail. Vistas are fairly widely spaced, but quite beautiful.\n\nIf lucky, users are able to park right on NY Route 9D near the western terminus of the Wilkinson Trail (yellow blazes). Start up this trail, which moderately ascends along mostly an old road. After 0.7 miles, turn right onto the Breakneck Bypass Trail (red blazes), which is generally steeper. At 1.6 miles, you reach the Breakneck Ridge Trail (white blazes), onto which users turn left. Soon thereafter, there is a short climb to a beautiful vista, after which the Breakneck Ridge Trail, which is joined by the Notch Trail (blue blazes) at the 1.9 mile mark, makes several descents/ascents. At 3.3 miles, take a left turn to stay on the Notch Trail, and take another left turn at 3.4 miles onto the Wilkinson Trail going toward Rte 9D. After a fairly short ascent (leading to a couple of viewpoints to the north and west), this trail then commences a fairly lengthy descent (at times quite steep!), eventually crossing Cascade Brook. The slope becomes much less steep as you parallel the brook for a while and then cross a sometimes boggy flat area.

The trail is marked with red paint however blue paint use to be used and is still visible in some parts, hiking trails are marked with varnished wood signs while mountain bike trails have white signs. \n\nStart in the parking lot alongside the Carriage House (bowling alley) and follow the dirt and grass road towards the woods. Once entering the woods you will cross a small wood bridge and follow a trails sign directing you to the left and down a small hill towards the Bearback Brook. Cross a larger bridge and follow the trail to the left along the side of the stream. About 50 yards after the bridge look for a hiking sign pointing up a small embankment to the right. On top of this small embankment the trial will intersect with a larger trail and you will go right. The trail will then continue to tac up the hill with a few smaller mountain bike paths intersecting it, however stay on the larger trail. You will cross over a stonewall and a short distance after that you will enter the bottom of the Daisy Field. Upon entering the field you will see a trails sign pointing left, follow the trail to the left and up diagonally crossing the field. Near the upper right corner of the field the trail will re-enter the woods marked by a trails sign pointing straight ahead. \n\nBefore entering the woods take a minute to turnaround and enjoy the view of the mountain range. The trail will be relatively straight and parts are covered in red shale gravel. A few minutes later you will come to a small incline with a sign pointing to the right for Websters Pass. Take this sharp right turn up a small hill and into another small clearing with a lean to on the right side. Continue straight past the lean to (after taking a rest of course) and there will be a sign for Websters Pass pointing straight ahead. \n\nOnce entering the woods the ground will be covered with grass on both sides of the trial, this land used to be sheep pastures in the late 1800\u2019s. After a short distance you will come to an intersection with Pitch Pine Path, continue straight and you will soon cross onto State Land and the trail will remain relatively flat for a little while. You will soon cross a small stream bed and in a short distance you will come to an intersection with the Lost Pond trail, continue straight on Webster\u2019s Pass and soon you will see a stonewall on the right which runs down to another small stream bed. You will soon cross this small stream bed and in 10 -15 feet the trail will split and a sign for Websters Pass will direct you to the left and the stream will be on your left now. You will arrive at the turn-off for the Indian Lookout and Rips Rock trail on the left, bear to the left and follow the trail up a rocky hill. The trail will level out for a little before regaining its upward slope.

Pratt Rock Park is open to the public every day. The climb to the rocks is steep, and may be unfit for young children, but the path is clear and ascents a series of gently graded inclines to the carved cliff wall 500 feet above the road. The sculptures and the view of the valley make the short climb more than worth the effort.\"  \n\n\"America's First Mt. Rushmore\" was carved into a cliff side south of Prattsville, NY, to please Zadock Pratt, wealthy entrepreneur, congressman and husband of five wives. Pratt ran the biggest shoe leather tannery in the world and loved to promote himself. The story goes that one day in 1843 a jobless man asked Zadock for a handout. Pratt, who believed in workfare not welfare, asked the man what he did for a living. When the man replied that he was a stonecutter, Zadock pointed to the cliff overlooking his 350-acre farm and told him to start carving Zadock's life story. The luckless laborer didn't stop until Zadock finally died, 28 years later. There is a serpentine path up the hill that allows for close-up inspection and a dizzying view of the Schoharie River below. The path is narrow, steep and crumbly. Zadock planned to be buried in a tomb carved into the cliff beneath his own giant head, but it leaked water whenever it rained so the plan was abandoned. The tomb now makes a handy shelter for changing film or camcorder batteries. However, Pratt Rock is graced with the common grave of six of Zadock's favorite horses and dogs, all lying beneath a big mound marked with a tombstone near the picnic tables.", "duration_minutes": 68, "duration_minutes_hiking": 68, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 34, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 25, "duration_minutes_cycling": 19, "objectID": "trail-10257432"}, {"ID": 10347162, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/wittenberg-cornell-and-slide-mountain-trail", "popularity": 10.9515, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 42.03629, "lng": -74.35829}, "length": 19794.882, "elevation_gain": 1372.8192, "difficulty_rating": "5", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10180629, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/catskill-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 6419, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 22240238, "activities": ["backpacking", "camping", "hiking", "nature-trips", "trail-running"], "profile_photo_data": "19176210-0c5cbcd0b83609969aee06fb0314a702", "num_reviews": 106, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 2263, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1578529836, "name": "Wittenberg, Cornell, and Slide Mountain Trail", "city_name": "Phoenicia", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Catskill Park", "duration_minutes": 500, "duration_minutes_hiking": 500, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 250, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 183, "duration_minutes_cycling": 142, "objectID": "trail-10347162"}, {"ID": 10300219, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/gorge-trail-loop", "popularity": 10.9467, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 42.5208, "lng": -77.69474}, "length": 2414.01, "elevation_gain": 96.9264, "difficulty_rating": "1", "route_type": "L", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10113964, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/stony-brook-state-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 2016, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 65284019, "activities": ["hiking", "nature-trips"], "profile_photo_data": "21454262-7264efdf5421f1f59ff1975b486a1cbc", "num_reviews": 214, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 676, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1577740865, "name": "Gorge Trail Loop", "city_name": "Dansville", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Stony Brook State Park", "description": "The route runs in one direction - you can take West Rim trail from the main parking lot to the head of the Gorge trail to make it a loop.\n\nThere is a $7 fee per car to get into the park.", "duration_minutes": 44, "duration_minutes_hiking": 44, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 22, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 16, "duration_minutes_cycling": 12, "objectID": "trail-10300219"}, {"ID": 10272458, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/rogers-rock", "popularity": 10.9386, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 43.79367, "lng": -73.48645}, "length": 5632.69, "elevation_gain": 245.9736, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "1", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10161304, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/rogers-rock-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 17963, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 45563122, "activities": ["hiking", "trail-running"], "profile_photo_data": "47783481-ad4673f0866379323dfc07c1346a2d4d", "num_reviews": 230, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 335, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1535047596, "name": "Rogers Rock", "city_name": "Hague", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Rogers Rock Park", "description": "Please note the directions currently do not bring you to the trailhead, but instead to a popular parking spot about a 1/2 a mile from the trailhead.

end of Pocket Road in the city of Beacon, where there is room for a few cars to park at the western terminus of the Fishkill Ridge Trail (white). The trail immediately starts a moderate climb up a scenic ravine, paralleling Dry Brook for about 0.5 miles. Shortly after crossing the brook (interesting in high water), you can see the cascade known as Rainbow Falls above you. At this point the trail turns sharply left and you climb (fairly steeply) along an unnamed stream, eventually reaching a fairly level area and meeting a wide (dirt) maintenance road at 1.0 miles. Turn right onto the road and continue climbing.\n\nAt 1.3 miles you will see the dam forming the Beacon Reservoir in front of you. Follow a very washed-out road to the left which goes around the east side of the reservoir and then swing to the south following an unmarked path/road until you reach an intersection with the Casino Trail (red) at 1.8 miles. Turn right. In less than 0.1 miles, turn left to ascend the Breakneck Ridge Trail (white) to the Beacon Fire Tower on South Beacon Mountain. After taking in the fabulous, 360\u00b0 view, retrace your steps back to the Casino Trail. Turn left and follow the old road to the site of the old casino overlooking the city of Beacon at 3 miles.\n\nRetrace your steps on the Casino Trail, and then, at 3.4 miles, turn left to ascend North Beacon Mountain exploring the area (including the DAR monument there) before descending on the maintenance road until you reach the intersection with the Fishkill Ridge Trail, where you turn left and return to your starting point.", "duration_minutes": 188, "duration_minutes_hiking": 188, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 94, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 69, "duration_minutes_cycling": 53, "objectID": "trail-10342427"}, {"ID": 10293589, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/windham-high-peak-via-black-dome-range-trailhead", "popularity": 10.8803, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 42.28897, "lng": -74.11501}, "length": 11909.116, "elevation_gain": 642.8232, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "1", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10163143, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/windham-blackhead-range-wilderness", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 32064, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 18253220, "activities": ["hiking", "trail-running"], "profile_photo_data": "40333816-74e6bc8f2b76328794d2bd92231cbf87", "num_reviews": 168, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 995, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1535746436, "name": "Windham High Peak via Black Dome Range Trailhead", "city_name": "Windham", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Windham-Blackhead Range Wilderness", "duration_minutes": 261, "duration_minutes_hiking": 261, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 130, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 95, "duration_minutes_cycling": 74, "objectID": "trail-10293589"}, {"ID": 10774404, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/thomas-mountain--2", "popularity": 10.8792, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 43.60362, "lng": -73.69306}, "length": 4828.02, "elevation_gain": 233.7816, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "1", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10163239, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/lake-george-wild-forest", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 796, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 58661563, "activities": ["hiking", "snowshoeing"], "profile_photo_data": "29063261-7476928dc6c32e96ea6cff24aa3279c4", "num_reviews": 290, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 540, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1607959485, "name": "Thomas Mountain", "city_name": "Bolton Landing", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Lake George Wild Forest", "duration_minutes": 100, "duration_minutes_hiking": 100, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 50, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 37, "duration_minutes_cycling": 28, "objectID": "trail-10774404"}, {"ID": 10241090, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/saratoga-national-park-battlefield-trail", "popularity": 10.8753, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 43.013, "lng": -73.64917}, "length": 18507.41, "elevation_gain": 217.932, "difficulty_rating": "1", "route_type": "L", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10120356, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/saratoga-national-historical-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 7872, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 13571555, "activities": ["birding", "hiking", "road-biking", "scenic-driving", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "26770704-74f82f323128b3662d23fb0ee50af23e", "num_reviews": 218, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 177, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1539901869, "name": "Saratoga National Park Battlefield Road Tour Trail", "city_name": "Stillwater", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Saratoga National Historical Park", "description": "The Saratoga National Historical Park is within the Saratoga Battlefield in Stillwater, New York. The Tour Road is open usually from April 1 to mid-November depending upon weather conditions. \n\nYou can walk, drive, or do a bike tour of the Battlefields on a beautifully paved roadway that features a nice bike lane. The bike lane is along the right edge of the roadway and is 4 feet wide and is intended for hikers as well. The tour road is one-way and loops through the battlefields exiting at the park entrance road near State Rt. 4 and the Hudson River. \n \nThe stops and informational signs introduce you to the history of the Battles of Saratoga in 1777 and the scenic views are breathtaking overlooking the upper Hudson River valley. \n\nIf sharing the roadway with motor vehicles, using reflector strips, mounted lights, or bright flags is recommended for safety.\n\nAccessibility: Please check with your local law enforcement officials about which direction mobility equipment users are supposed to travel on roadways before proceeding.\n\nThere are 2 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of State Highway 32 at the northwest end of the trail. Both of them are van-accessible with a striped access aisle. The trail surface is paved asphalt and smooth. It is typically at least 3 feet wide (with some wider passing spaces). The route uses a bike lane on the side of the road marked with a painted line for all of the trail. The most accessible portion of the trail avoids the Nielson House at stop #2.\n\nThe majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle grade category (5% or less) but there are steeper sections at about 2.6, 5.2, and 8.5 through 9.6 miles when going counterclockwise. Hikers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the steeper sections or to avoid them for safety. There are benches and picnic tables along the route for resting.

You will not only travel along these beds, but also see other mining-related items such as a small vertical mine shaft just off the trail, as well as mine dumps.  Almost by definition, the part of the loop that traverses the old mine bed is quite flat, but other sections have moderate ups and downs.\n\nAlthough there is very limited parking on Sunken Mine Road near the Old Mine RR trailhead, vehicular traffic is not allowed on this road during the winter.  Park in a lot (for about 8-10 cars) at the intersection of Dennytown Road and Sunken Mine Road. Walk on the latter (mild descent) for 0.3 miles, then turn left onto the Old Mine RR Trail (yellow), which crosses over a small ridge, with views of John Allen Pond on your right.  At 0.7 miles, turn left onto the bed of an old railroad, which you follow until you turn right at 1 mile onto another, but wider railroad bed.  Continue past the intersection with the Charcoal Burners Trail (red) at 1.4 miles until you reach the southern end of Hidden Lake at 1.8 miles.  Turn right and cross the outlet stream of the lake on some rocks.  You reach the end of the Old Mine RR Trail at 2 miles, at which point you turn right onto the 3-Lakes Trail (blue).  Follow this trail past another intersection with the Charcoal Burners Trail, shortly after which you make a moderate descent before turning right onto another short stretch of railroad bed.  Shortly after you leave it again, on the right you will see a collapsed dam which the original RR bed traversed. When the trail reaches the shore of John Allen Pond, it parallels the shoreline for a while, then descends to a (sometimes iffy in high water!) stream crossing, with a small waterfall to your right at a break in the dam.

It winds its way up to Fishkill Ridge, from the top of which there are spectacular views south to New York City.  You then climb Lamb's Hill, which provides equally spectacular views to the northwest out to the Catskill Mountains.  Parts are relatively level, but there are also some some steep climbs and descents.  Although the loop can be done in either direction, you're most likely to recognize the viewpoints if you go in the (below-described) counter-clockwise direction.\n\nThe biggest \"issue\" is parking, as there is none at the trailhead.  Probably the best place is on the shoulder of Old Albany Post Road right after you turn off US Rte 9.\n\nWalk along Old Albany Post Rd, then turn onto Reservoir Lane.  (Don't worry about a \"No Access\" sign, as this is for vehicles.)  Shortly after you pass around a gate and over a bridge, the Wilkinson Trail (yellow) starts to the left, climbing moderately to skirt the Fishkill Reservoir, after which there are a number of ups and downs.  At around the 1-mile mark, the trail turns abruptly to the right and begins a moderately steep climb.  At 1.3 miles, there is a spot which, in the summertimes, is 5-10 degrees cooler than the surrounding area due to a generally-underground stream.  (Be sure to make a right turn here!) There is a short stretch of level going, followed by another moderately steep ascent to a T-junction with an old road at 1.6 miles.  Turn right onto the Fishkill Ridge Trail (white), which is fairly level for about a mile.  Be sure to turn sharply left at 2.8 miles at the point where the trail leaves the road to climb up to the next level of the ridge, the one on which you get the NYC views.  This leg has a number of ups and downs.  At 4.4 miles you cross an old road at what is called \"Dozer Junction\" and then you climb a bit more to ascend Lamb's Hill, with its views.  The descent from Lamb's Hill is quite steep/rocky.  At 5.4 miles, turn left onto an un-blazed, but obvious old road.  At 5.6 miles a blue-blazed trail joins the road.  At 5.7 miles, the Wilkinson Trail (yellow) joins from the right.  Stay straight and you'll complete the loop at the start of the Fishkill Ridge Trail at 5.9 miles.

You make essentially 4 longer climbs along the trail in order to get to the red-blazed Breakneck Bypass Trail. Instead of taking this option, however, keep on going on the Breakneck Ridge Trail, with a number of ups and downs along the way, passing a couple more trail intersections involving the blue-blazed Notch Trail which first joins from the right and later leaving to the left the Breakneck Ridge Trail. Shortly after the latter, you leave the woods road which the trail has been following, turning left to make a climb up to what is generally known as Sunset Point, where you pass a raised wooden platform to the left of the trail). In a bit you'll make a long, quite steep descent, At the bottom, you cross Squirrel Hollow Brook, and then turn right onto a woods road which is the path of the yellow-blazed Wilkinson Trail. After 0.1 mile, the Breakneck Ridge Trail turns left (leaving the woods road/Wilkinson Trail) to begin a quite steep and eventually rock-scramblingly steep ascent to reach the fire tower. This has a spectacular 360deg view, including the Catskill Mtns to the north and New York City to the south (assuming a day which has reasonably clean air). After enjoying this, retrace your steps about 20 yards, and take the Breakneck Ridge Trail as it starts down the north side of the mountain. When you reach the red-blazed Casino Trail, make a right turn. The Casino Trail officially ends (although the woods road it follows continues on) where the woods road you're on crosses the Wilkinson Trail. Turn right onto the Wilkinson Trail (yellow blazes) and follow it downhill, passing where the Breakneck Ridge Trail joins from the right and leaves to the left. Eventually, you'll reach an intersection where the Wilkinson Trail turns left to join the blue-blazed Notch Trail in ascending to the ridge. Stay straight on the Notch Trail, making sure to stay right at a Y-junction. After a slight climb, the Notch Trail descends moderately, eventually crossing Gordon's Brook, immediately after which the trail turns left. Continue on the Notch Trail, making sure to stay on the trail, despite numerous intersecting woods roads. You will eventually reach the end of the Notch Trail at NY Route 9D. Route 9D is a busy road with no shoulder, hikers should set a shuttle to finish the loop, or some have used a ride share service to get back to the original trailhead.\n\nAn alternate option that creates a full loop on trail is: https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-york/breakneck-ridge-trail-to-south-beacon-mountain", "duration_minutes": 278, "duration_minutes_hiking": 278, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 139, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 101, "duration_minutes_cycling": 79, "objectID": "trail-10358406"}, {"ID": 10001931, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/treadway-mountain-trail", "popularity": 9.903, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 43.83758, "lng": -73.57147}, "length": 13679.39, "elevation_gain": 399.8976, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10158187, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/pharaoh-lake-wilderness", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 25188, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 30598459, "activities": ["birding", "hiking", "nature-trips", "trail-running"], "profile_photo_data": "28393017-1a6ae0113be239bd098e27c347b16eb0", "num_reviews": 165, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 180, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1572365432, "name": "Treadway Mountain Trail", "city_name": "Paradox", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Pharaoh Lake Wilderness", "description": "This trail area mandates that users with dogs must have proof that their dogs have tested negative for rabies.

If you only want to do either the Upper or the Lower Yellow Trail, you will either need to make it and out & back or park a car at each end, otherwise the road walk on Centerline Road is 9/10th of a mile.\n\nThe Hennig Preserve, located just outside of the Adirondack Park, is Saratoga PLAN\u2019s largest nature preserve, boasting ~ 606 conserved acres of land with approximately 10 miles of trails riddled throughout.\n\nThe Hennig Preserve was generously donated to Saratoga PLAN by the Hennig family in the fall of 2010. Bob Hennig, Penny Steffen, Barbara Hennig and the late Mally Sue Bleikamp Hennig lovingly cared for this land for over 50 years and accumulated the acreage that would become this preserve in many stages. Prior to their ownership, this land was used primarily for subsistence farming, logging, charcoal-making and maple syrup production, among other things.\n\nSaratoga PLAN manages the property as a natural area for native forest and wetland flora and fauna. It is open to the public for passive recreation such as hiking and walking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and nature study.  A conservation easement placed in 2002 on the preserve, as well as on an additional 140 adjacent acres, prevents all other uses.\n\nFor more information, go to https://www.saratogaplan.org/explore/public-preserves-trails/hennig-preserve", "duration_minutes": 102, "duration_minutes_hiking": 102, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 51, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 37, "duration_minutes_cycling": 29, "objectID": "trail-10536627"}, {"ID": 10040592, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/virgil-mountain-trail", "popularity": 9.857, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 42.4871, "lng": -76.16135}, "length": 7724.832, "elevation_gain": 235.9152, "difficulty_rating": "3", "route_type": "L", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10160400, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/kennedy-state-forest", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 1836, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 47594513, "activities": ["birding", "hiking", "nature-trips", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "19337901-6b6544d70e6eb56a79fe3dce24c9fcff", "num_reviews": 275, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 267, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1506571726, "name": "Virgil Mountain Trail", "city_name": "Cortland", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Kennedy State Forest", "duration_minutes": 131, "duration_minutes_hiking": 131, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 65, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 48, "duration_minutes_cycling": 37, "objectID": "trail-10040592"}, {"ID": 10295135, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/alander-mountain-trail-via-south-taconic-trail", "popularity": 9.8499, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 42.06521, "lng": -73.51549}, "length": 7081.096, "elevation_gain": 465.7344, "difficulty_rating": "5", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10111005, "area_slug": "parks/us/massachusetts/mount-washington-state-forest", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 13705, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 72548836, "activities": ["hiking"], "profile_photo_data": "30165372-a8c7850a448a2ef5f4b29e22af5f327b", "num_reviews": 125, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 531, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1552079770, "name": "Alander Mountain Trail via South Taconic Trail", "city_name": "Copake", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Mount Washington State Forest", "description": "The route on this page is for the less trafficked New York side (western) approach to Alander Mountain.

Tonawanda, NY.\n\nIts eastern terminus is in Audubon Town Park, off Forest Road. Its western terminus is where the trail intersects Highway 62 (Niagara Falls Blvd). However, you can continue west through Ellicott Creek Park another 0.8 miles before crossing Creekside Drive where the Erie Canalway Trail begins.\n\nAccessibility: There do not appear to be any designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of Park Road at the northwest end of the trail. The trail surface is paved asphalt (with partial railings) and smooth. It is typically at least 5 feet wide (with many wider passing spaces). There is a painted dividing line along some of the trail which reduces the width.\n\nThe majority of the trail is estimated to be in the gentle grade category (5% or less). This trail will likely be navigable for most wheelchairs/mobility equipment or stroller users. There are benches and picnic tables along the route for resting.

This is not a casual hiking trail. This route includes a difficult mix of hiking and scrambling with class 4 climbs. The trail and weather conditions may make this route even more difficult with snow or ice. The scramble is not for novice hikers! Proper gear is recommended. Please do your research before attempting this route.\n\nBefore you go: Please know that the Trap Dike route up Mount Colden in the High Peaks Region is not an official trail\u2014in fact, it's not a trail at all. This route is classified as a rock-climbing route and requires planning and preparation for this type of activity. This route should be avoided by those who don't have rock climbing experience and equipment like a climbing rope and helmet. Without the proper equipment, this route can be unsafe, and even life-threatening.\nPortions of the Trap Dike are referred to as \u201cno fall zones,\u201d meaning that an accidental fall without a rope could result in serious physical injury or death. Due to the technical nature and conditions of the route, it is extremely difficult and hazardous to descend if one needs to turn back. DEC recommends utilizing an experienced licensed guide to safely assist in enjoying the Trap Dike. This route should always be avoided after any rain or if there is a chance of rain in the forecast. In recent weeks, DEC Forest Rangers have had to rescue numerous people who have become stuck on the climb due to lack of equipment, slippery conditions, or all-around unpreparedness for the route. Rescues in the dike can be complex and dangerous rescues for everyone involved.

Taurus - views south to NYC on the south side of the peak and, on the north side of the peak, views to the northwest as far out as the Catskill Mountains.\n\nYou can usually park right at the trailhead, where there is space for about 5 cars (with another such layby about 30 yards further east on Fishkill Road).  You start out on the Lone Star Trail (blue blazes), which climbs fairly gently along an old woods road.  After 0.3 miles, turn left onto the Split Rock Trail (red blazes), which continues the climb until you reach the Nelsonville Trail (green blazes) at the 0.6 mile mark.  Turn left, and follow the Nelsonville Trail (an old road), losing most of the altitude you\u2019ve gained.  At 1.4 miles, turn right onto the Undercliff Trail (yellow blazes), which gradually gets steeper as it climbs up the south-southwest side of Bull Hill.  Be sure to keep an eye out for the yellow blazes - it\u2019s not so much that there aren\u2019t enough of them, but rather that there are quite a number of herd paths which can easily lead one off the blazed trail.  There are a couple of nice viewpoints to the south along the way (both are obvious).  At 2.6 miles, you reach the Washburn Trail (white blazes) onto which you turn right to continue up Bull Hill.  Just before you reach the summit, the trail does an almost-180 turn to the left.  On the rock outcrop at this point there is an asterisk with \u201cNYC\u201d painted on the rock.  Climb to the top of this outcrop and look directly south for a spectacular view of the Hudson River (with the Tappan Zee Bridge clearly visible) all the way down to the obvious skyline of New York City.  (This, of course, assumes the air quality allows such views!).  After one more short climb you reach the (quite flat) summit of Bull Hill, which the trail traverses.  On the north side of the summit, there is another spectacular view, this time to the north and west, ranging from Breakneck Ridge in the foreground, past Newburgh, then the Shawangunk Ridge, all the way to the Catskill Mountains.  The Washburn Trail then winds down the north side of Bull Hill on an old road until, at 3.8 miles,  it ends at an intersection with the Notch Trail (blue blazes) and the Nelsonville Trail (green blazes).  Stay straight on the Nelsonville Trail, which continues to follow the old road down the mountain.  At 4.3 miles, turn left onto the Lone Star Trail (blue blazes) and continue on this trail as it descends.  At 4.6 miles, be sure to make a sharp right turn to stay on the Lone Star Trail.  (The fairly new Highlands Trail segment goes straight at this point.)  At 5.4 miles, you will have returned to your starting point.", "duration_minutes": 182, "duration_minutes_hiking": 182, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 91, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 66, "duration_minutes_cycling": 52, "objectID": "trail-10323870"}, {"ID": 10311279, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/potato-field-and-maple-grove-trail-loop", "popularity": 9.2117, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 44.25385, "lng": -73.97202}, "length": 4184.284, "elevation_gain": 71.9328, "difficulty_rating": "1", "route_type": "L", "visitor_usage": "1", "avg_rating": 4.5, "area_id": 10163395, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/john-browns-farm-historic-site", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 4356, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 19082303, "activities": ["hiking", "nature-trips", "snowshoeing", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "21134317-6196a2bb9177e0db70ea33dc9d99857d", "num_reviews": 182, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 107, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1534539984, "name": "Potato Field and Maple Grove Trail Loop", "city_name": "Lake Placid", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "John Brown's Farm Historic Site", "duration_minutes": 59, "duration_minutes_hiking": 59, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 30, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 22, "duration_minutes_cycling": 17, "objectID": "trail-10311279"}, {"ID": 10339564, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/haystack-and-mckenzie-mountain-loop", "popularity": 9.2037, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 44.29272, "lng": -74.05108}, "length": 19151.146, "elevation_gain": 1006.7544, "difficulty_rating": "5", "route_type": "O", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.0, "area_id": 10165411, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/mckenzie-mountain-wilderness-area", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 6816, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 20513683, "activities": ["backpacking", "hiking", "nature-trips", "trail-running"], "profile_photo_data": "23636534-675ff3f317ce75ff097aefce9f3f5b63", "num_reviews": 155, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 1418, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1574366170, "name": "Haystack and McKenzie Mountain Loop", "city_name": "Ray Brook", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "McKenzie Mountain Wilderness Area ", "duration_minutes": 414, "duration_minutes_hiking": 414, "duration_minutes_trail_running": 207, "duration_minutes_mountain_biking": 151, "duration_minutes_cycling": 117, "objectID": "trail-10339564"}, {"ID": 10030203, "slug": "trail/us/new-york/eisenhower-park", "popularity": 9.2016, "type": "trail", "_geoloc": {"lat": 40.72928, "lng": -73.57789}, "length": 5471.756, "elevation_gain": 15.8496, "difficulty_rating": "1", "route_type": "L", "visitor_usage": "2", "avg_rating": 4.0, "area_id": 10141788, "area_slug": "parks/us/new-york/eisenhower-county-park", "country_id": 313, "city_id": 3572, "state_id": 33, "verified_map_id": 13271575, "activities": ["birding", "road-biking", "trail-running", "walking"], "profile_photo_data": "37400302-77d5e447d945eaed3d28f9bdf2b382b4", "num_reviews": 305, "has_profile_photo": true, "num_photos": 112, "units": "i", "is_closed": false, "is_private_property": false, "created_at": 1555960694, "name": "Eisenhower Park Loop ", "city_name": "Hempstead", "state_name": "New York", "country_name": "United States", "area_name": "Eisenhower County Park", "description": "In this park, you will find a beautiful lake to enjoy, and right next to the lake is a 9/11 Memorial (a must-see) and the War Memorial.

At the end of the journey you are brought to Indian Lake, which is one of the most peaceful spots in all the Southern Adirondacks. The trail ends at the shore of this scenic and untouched beauty.
